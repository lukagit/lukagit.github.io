 DO YOU THINK I’M  sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming
a multiplanetary species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet—to cope with a worstcase scenario happening and extinguishing human consciousness—then,” and here he paused for a
moment, “I think that would be really good.”
If some of the things that Musk says and does sound absurd, that’s because on one level they very
much are. On this occasion, for example, Musk’s assistant had just handed him some cookies-andcream ice cream with sprinkles on top, and he then talked earnestly about saving humanity while a
blotch of the dessert hung from his lower lip.
Musk’s ready willingness to tackle impossible things has turned him into a deity in Silicon Valley,
where fellow CEOs like Page speak of him in reverential awe, and budding entrepreneurs strive “to
be like Elon” just as they had been striving in years past to mimic Steve Jobs. Silicon Valley, though,
operates within a warped version of reality, and outside the confines of its shared fantasy, Musk often
comes off as a much more polarizing figure. He’s the guy with the electric cars, solar panels, and
rockets peddling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P. T. Barnum who has
gotten extraordinarily rich by preying on people’s fear and self-hatred. Buy a Tesla. Forget about the
mess you’ve made of the planet for a while.
I’d long been a subscriber to this latter camp. Musk had struck me as a well-intentioned dreamer
—a card-carrying member of Silicon Valley’s techno-utopian club. This group tends to be a mix of
Ayn Rand devotees and engineer absolutists who see their hyperlogical worldviews as the Answer
for everyone. If we’d just get out of their way, they’d fix all our problems. One day, soon enough,
we’ll be able to download our brains to a computer, relax, and let their algorithms take care of
everything. Much of their ambition proves inspiring and their works helpful. But the techno-utopians
do get tiresome with their platitudes and their ability to prattle on for hours without saying much of
substance. More disconcerting is their underlying message that humans are flawed and our humanity is
an annoying burden that needs to be dealt with in due course. When I’d caught Musk at Silicon Valley
events, his highfalutin talk often sounded straight out of the techno-utopian playbook. And, most
annoyingly, his world-saving companies didn’t even seem to be doing all that well.
Yet, in the early part of 2012, the cynics like me had to take notice of what Musk was actually
accomplishing. His once-beleaguered companies were succeeding at unprecedented things. SpaceX
flew a supply capsule to the International Space Station and brought it safely back to Earth. Tesla
Motors delivered the Model S, a beautiful, all-electric sedan that took the automotive industry’s
breath away and slapped Detroit sober. These two feats elevated Musk to the rarest heights among
business titans. Only Steve Jobs could claim similar achievements in two such different industries,
sometimes putting out a new Apple product and a blockbuster Pixar movie in the same year. And yet,
Musk was not done. He was also the chairman and largest shareholder of SolarCity, a booming solar
energy company poised to file for an initial public offering. Musk had somehow delivered the biggest
advances the space, automotive, and energy industries had seen in decades in what felt like one fell
swoop.
It was in 2012 that I decided to see what Musk was like firsthand and to write a cover story about
him for Bloomberg Businessweek. At this point in Musk’s life, everything ran through his
assistant/loyal appendage Mary Beth Brown. She invited me to visit what I’ve come to refer to as
Musk Land.
Anyone arriving at Musk Land for the first time will have the same head-scratching experience.
You’re told to park at One Rocket Road in Hawthorne, where SpaceX has its HQ. It seems
impossible that anything good could call Hawthorne home. It’s a bleak part of Los Angeles County in
which groupings of rundown houses, run-down shops, and run-down eateries surround huge,
industrial complexes that appear to have been built during some kind of architectural Boring
Rectangle movement. Did Elon Musk really stick his company in the middle of this dreck? Then,
okay, things start to make more sense when you see one 550,000-square-foot rectangle painted an
ostentatious hue of “Unity of Body, Soul, and Mind” white. This is the main SpaceX building.
It was only after going through the front doors of SpaceX that the grandeur of what this man had
done became apparent. Musk had built an honest-to-God rocket factory in the middle of Los Angeles.
And this factory was not making one rocket at a time. No. It was making many rockets—from scratch.
The factory was a giant, shared work area. Near the back were massive delivery bays that allowed
for the arrival of hunks of metal, which were transported to two-story-high welding machines. Over
to one side were technicians in white coats making motherboards, radios, and other electronics. Other
people were in a special, airtight glass chamber, building the capsules that rockets would take to the
Space Station. Tattooed men in bandanas were blasting Van Halen and threading wires around rocket
engines. There were completed bodies of rockets lined up one after the other ready to be placed on
trucks. Still more rockets, in another part of the building, awaited coats of white paint. It was difficult
to take in the entire factory at once. There were hundreds of bodies in constant motion whirring
around a variety of bizarre machines.
This is just building number one of Musk Land. SpaceX had acquired several buildings that used
to be part of a Boeing factory, which made the fuselages for 747s. One of these buildings has a curved
roof and looks like an airplane hangar. It serves as the research, development, and design studio for
Tesla. This is where the company came up with the look for the Model S sedan and its follow-on, the
Model X SUV. In the parking lot outside the studio, Tesla has built one of its recharging stations
where Los Angeles drivers can top up with electricity for free. The charging center is easy enough to
spot because Musk has installed a white and red obelisk branded with the Tesla logo that sits in the
middle of an infinity pool.
It was in my first interview with Musk, which took place at the design studio, that I began to get a
sense of how he talked and operated. He’s a confident guy, but does not always do a good job of
displaying this. On initial encounter, said on the way. “That is part of the reason why we haven’t seen as
much innovation.”
MUSK LAND WAS A REVELATION.
I’d come to Silicon Valley in 2000 and ended up living in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San
Francisco. It’s the one part of the city that locals will implore you to avoid. Without trying very hard,
you can find someone pulling down his pants and pooping in between parked cars or encounter some
deranged sort bashing his head into the side of a bus stop. At dive bars near the local strip clubs,
transvestites hit on curious businessmen and drunks fall asleep on couches and soil themselves as part
of their lazy Sunday ritual. It’s the gritty, knife-stabby part of San Francisco and turned out to be a
great place to watch the dotcom dream die.
San Francisco has an enduring history with greed. It became a city on the back of the gold rush,
and not even a catastrophic earthquake could slow San Francisco’s economic lust for long. Don’t let
the granola vibes fool you. Booms and busts are the rhythm of this place. And, in 2000, San Francisco
had been overtaken by the boom of all booms and consumed by avarice. It was a wonderful time to be
alive with just about the entire populace giving in to a fantasy—a get-rich-quick, Internet madness.
The pulses of energy from this shared delusion were palpable, producing a constant buzz that vibrated
across the city. And here I was in the center of the most depraved part of San Francisco, watching just
how high and low people get when consumed by excess.
Stories tracking the insanity of business in these times are well-known. You no longer had to make
something that other people n, that the implosion of the get-rich-quick Internet fantasy left San
Francisco and Silicon Valley in a deep depression. The endless parties ended. The prostitutes no
longer roamed the streets of the Tenderloin at 6 A.M. offering pre-commute love. (“Come on, honey.
It’s better than coffee!”) Instead of the Barenaked Ladies, you got the occasional Neil Diamond tribute
band at a trade  systems since 1985, gaining direct insight into the
latest and greatest technology around materials, energy, and software. Following the dot-com bust, he
became miffed at the ho-hum nature of the supposed innovations crossing his desk. In 2005, Huebner
delivered a paper, “A Possible Declining Trend in Worldwide Innovation,” which was either an
indictment of Silicon Valley or at least an ominous warning.
Huebner opted to use a tree metaphor to describe what he saw as the state of innovation. Man has
already climbed past the trunk of the tree and gone out on its major limbs, mining most of the really
big, game-changing ideas—the wheel, electricity, the airplane, the telephone, the transistor. Now
we’re left dangling near the big, quick hit. Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307
million. Musk made $22 million from the deal and poured almost all of it into his next venture, a
start-up that would morph into PayPal. As the largest shareholder in PayPal, Musk became
fantastically well-to-do when eBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion in 2002.
Instead of hanging around Silicon Valley and falling into the same funk as his peers, however,
Musk decamped to Los Angeles. The conventional wisdom of the time said to take a deep breath and
wait for the next big thing to arrive in due course. Musk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million
into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. Short of building an actual
money-crushing machine, Musk could not have picked a faster way to destroy his fortune. He became
a one-man, ultra-risk-taking venture capital shop and doubled down on making super-complex
physical goods in two of the most expensive places in the world, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.
Whenever possible, Musk’s companies would make things from scratch and try to rethink much that
the aerospace, automotive, and solar industries had accepted as convention.
With SpaceX, Musk is battling the giants of the U.S. military-industrial complex, including
Lockheed Martin and Boeing. He’s also battling nations—most notably Russia and China. SpaceX has
made a name for itself as the low-cost supplier in the industry. But that, in and of itself, is not really
good enough to win. The space business requires dealing with a mess of politics, back-scratching,
and protectionism that undermines the fundamentals of capitalism. Steve Jobs faced similar forces
when he went up against the recording industry to bring the iPod and iTunes to market. The crotchety
Luddites in the music industry were a pleasure to deal with compared to Musk’s foes who build
weapons and countries for a living. SpaceX has been testing reusable rockets that can carry payloads
to space and land back on Earth, on their launchpads, with precision. If the company can perfect this
technology, it will deal a devastating blow to all of its competitors and almost assuredly push some
mainstays of the rocket industry out of business while establishing the United States as the world
leader for taking cargo and humans to space. It’s a threat that Musk figures has earned him plenty of
fierce enemies. “The list of people that would not mind if I was gone is growing,” Musk said. “My
family fears that the Russians will assassinate me.”
With Tesla Motors, Musk has tried to revamp the way cars are manufactured and sold, while
building out a worldwide fuel distribution network at the same time. Instead of hybrids, which in
Musk lingo are suboptimal compromises, Tesla strives to make all-electric cars that people lust after
and that push the limits of technology. Tesla does not sell these cars through dealers; it sells them on
the Web and in Apple-like galleries located in high-end shopping centers. Tesla also does not
anticipate making lots of money from servicing its vehicles, since electric cars do not require the oil
changes and other maintenance procedures of traditional cars. The direct sales model embraced by
Tesla stands as a major affront to car dealers used to haggling with their customers and making their
profits from exorbitant maintenance fees. Tesla’s recharging stations now run alongside many of the
major highways in the United States, Europe, and Asia and can add hundreds of miles of oomph back
to a car in about twenty minutes. These so-called supercharging stations are solar-powered, and Tesla
owners pay nothing to refuel. While much of America’s infrastructure decays, Musk is building a
futuristic end-to-end transportation system that would allow the United States to leapfrog the rest of
the world. Musk’s vision, and, of late, execution seem to combine the best of Henry Ford and John D.
Rockefeller.
With SolarCity, Musk has funded the largest installer and financer of solar panels for consumers
and businesses. Musk helped come up with the idea for SolarCity and serves as its chairman, while
his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive run the company. SolarCity has managed to undercut dozens of
utilities and become a large utility in its own right. During a time in which clean-tech businesses have
gone bankrupt with alarming regularity, Musk has built two of the most successful clean-tech
companies in the world. The Musk Co. empire of factories, tens of thousands of workers, and
industrial might has incumbents on the run and has turned Musk into one of the richest men in the
world, with a net worth around $10 billion.
The visit to Musk Land started to make a few things clear about how Musk had pulled all this off.
While the “putting man on Mars” talk can strike some people as loopy, it gave Musk a unique rallying
cry for his companies. It’s the sweeping goal that forms a unifying principle over everything he does.
Employees at all three companies are well aware of this and well aware that they’re trying to achieve
the impossible day in and day out. When Musk sets unrealistic goals, verbally abuses employees, and
works them to the bone, it’s understood to be—on some level—part of the Mars agenda. Some
employees love him for this. Others loathe him but remain oddly loyal out of respect for his drive and
mission. What Musk has developed that so many of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley lack is a
meaningful worldview. He’s the possessed genius on the grandest quest anyone has ever concocted.
He’s less a CEO chasing riches than a general marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark
Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to . . . well . . . save the human race
from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.
The life that Musk has created to manage all of these endeavors is preposterous. A typical week
starts at his mansion in Bel Air. On Monday, he works the entire day at SpaceX. On Tuesday, he
begins at SpaceX, then hops onto his jet and flies to Silicon Valley. He spends a couple of days
working at Tesla, which has its offices in Palo Alto and factory in Fremont. Musk does not own a
home in Northern California and ends up staying at the luxe Rosewood hotel or at friends’ houses. To
arrange the stays with friends, Musk’s assistant will send an e-mail asking, “Room for one?” and if
the friend says, “Yes,” Musk turns up at the door late at night. Most often he stays in a guest room, but
he’s also been known to crash on the couch after winding down with some video games. Then it’s
back to Los Angeles and SpaceX on Thursday. He shares custody of his five young boys—twins and
triplets—with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them four days a week. Each year, Musk tabulates the
amount of flight time he endures per week to help him get a sense of just how out of hand things are
getting. Asked how he survives this schedule, Musk said, “I had a tough childhood, so maybe that was
helpful.”
During one visit to Musk Land, he had to squeeze our interview in before heading off for a
camping trip at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. It was almost 8 P.M. on a Friday, so Musk would
soon be piling his boys and nannies into his private jet and then meeting drivers who would take him
to his friends at the campsite; the friends would then help the Musk clan unpack and complete their
pitch-black arrival. There would be a bit of hiking over the weekend. Then the relaxation would end.
Musk would fly with the boys back to Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. Then, he would take off on
his own that evening for New York. Sleep. Hit the morning talk shows on Monday. Meetings. E-mail.
Sleep. Fly back to Los Angeles Tuesday morning. Work at SpaceX. Fly to San Jose Tuesday afternoon
to visit the Tesla Motors factory. Fly to Washington, D.C., that night and see President Obama. Fly
back to Los Angeles Wednesday night. Spend a couple of days working at SpaceX. Then go to a
weekend conference held by Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, in Yellowstone. At this time, Musk
had just split from his second wife, the actress Talulah Riley, and was trying to calculate if he could
mix a personal life into all of this. “I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going
fine,” Musk said. “I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend.
That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to ten—how
much time does a woman want a week? Maybe ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”
Musk rarely finds time to decompress, but when he does, the festivities are just as dramatic as the
rest of his life. On his thirtieth birthday, Musk rented out a castle in England for about twenty people.
From 2 A.M. until 6 A.M., they played a variation of hide-and-seek called sardines in which one
person runs off and hides and everyone else looks for him. Another party occurred in Paris. Musk, his
brother, and cousins found themselves awake at midnight and decided to bicycle through the city until
6 A.M. They slept all day and then boarded the Orient Express in the evening. Once again, they stayed
up all night. The Lucent Dossier Experience—an avant-garde group of performers—were on the
luxurious train, performing palm readings and acrobatics. When the train arrived in Venice the next
day, Musk’s family had dinner and then hung out on the patio of their hotel overlooking the Grand
Canal until 9 A.M. Musk loves costume parties as well, and turned up at one dressed like a knight and
using a parasol to duel a midget wearing a Darth Vader costume.
For one of his most recent birthdays, Musk invited fifty people to a castle—or at least the United
States’ best approximation of a castle—in Tarrytown, New York. This party had a Japanese
steampunk theme, which is sort of like a sci-fi lover’s wet dream—a mix of corsets, leather, and
machine worship. Musk dressed as a samurai.
The festivities included a performance of The Mikado, a Victorian comic opera by Gilbert and
Sullivan set in Japan, at a small theater in the heart of town. “I am not sure the Americans got it,” said
Riley, whom Musk remarried after his ten-hour-a-week dating plan failed. The Americans and
everyone else did enjoy what followed. Back at the castle, Musk donned a blindfold, got pushed up
against a wall, and held balloons in each hand and another between his legs. The knife thrower then
went to work. “I’d seen him before, but did worry that maybe he could have an off day,” Musk said.
“Still, I thought, he would maybe hit one gonad but not both.” The onlookers were stunned and
frightened for Musk’s safety. “That was bizarre,” said Bill Lee, a technology investor and one of
Musk’s good friends. “But Elon believes in the science of things.” One of the world’s top sumo
wrestlers showed up at the party along with some of his compatriots. A ring had been set up at the
castle, and Musk faced off against the champion. “He was three hundred and fifty pounds, and they
were not jiggly pounds,” Musk said. “I went full adrenaline rush and managed to lift the guy off the
ground. He let me win that first round and then beat me. I think my back is still screwed up.”
Riley turned planning these types of parties for Musk into an art. She met Musk back in 2008,
when his companies were collapsing. She watched him lose his entire fortune and get ridiculed by the
press. She knows that the sting of these years remains and has combined with the other traumas in
Musk’s life—the tragic loss of an infant son and a brutal upbringing in South Africa—to create a
tortured soul. Riley has gone to great lengths to make sure Musk’s escapes from work and this past
leave him feeling refreshed if not healed. “I try to think of fun things he has not done before where he
can relax,” Riley said. “We’re trying to make up for his miserable childhood now.”
Genuine as Riley’s efforts might have been, they were not entirely effective. Not long after the
Sumo party, I found Musk back at work at the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto. It was a Saturday, and
the parking lot was full of cars. Inside of the Tesla offices, hundreds of young men were at work—
some of them designing car parts on computers and others conducting experiments with electronics
equipment on their desks. Musk’s uproarious laugh would erupt every few minutes and carry through
the entire floor. When Musk came into the meeting room where I’d been waiting, I noted how
impressive it was for so many people to turn up on a Saturday. Musk saw the situation in a different
light, complaining that fewer and fewer people had been working weekends of late. “We’ve grown
fucking soft,” Musk replied. “I was just going to send out an e-mail. We’re fucking soft.” (A word of
warning: There’s going to be a lot of “fuck” in this book. Musk adores the word, and so do most of
the people in his inner circle.)
This kind of declaration seems to fit with our impressions of other visionaries. It’s not hard to
imagine Howard Hughes or Steve Jobs chastising their workforce in a similar way. Building things—
especially big things—is a messy business. In the two decades Musk has spent creating companies,
he’s left behind a trail of people who either adore or despise him. During the course of my reporting,
these people lined up to give me their take on Musk and the gory details of how he and his businesses
operate.
My dinners with Musk and periodic trips to Musk Land revealed a different set of possible truths
about the man. He’s set about building something that has the potential to be much grander than
anything Hughes or Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that
America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic. At the heart of
this transformation are Musk’s skills as a software maker and his ability to apply them to machines.
He’s merged atoms and bits in ways that few people thought possible, and the results have been
spectacular. It’s true enough that Musk has yet to have a consumer hit on the order of the iPhone or to
touch more than one billion people like Facebook. For the moment, he’s still making rich people’s
toys, and his budding empire could be an exploded rocket or massive Tesla recall away from
collapse. On the other hand, Musk’s companies have already accomplished far more than his loudest
detractors thought possible, and the promise of what’s to come has to leave hardened types feeling
optimistic during their weaker moments. “To me, Elon is the shining example of how Silicon Valley
might be able to reinvent itself and be more relevant than chasing these quick IPOs and focusing on
getting incremental products out,” said Edward Jung, a famed software engineer and inventor. “Those
things are important, but they are not enough. We need to look at different models of how to do things
that are longer term in nature and where the technology is more integrated.” The integration mentioned
by Jung—the harmonious melding of software, electronics, advanced materials, and computing
horsepower—appears to be Musk’s gift. Squint ever so slightly, and it looks like Musk could be using
his skills to pave the way toward an age of astonishing machines and science fiction dreams made
manifest.
In that sense, Musk comes off much more like Thomas Edison than Howard Hughes. He’s an
inventor, celebrity businessman, and industrialist able to take big ideas and turn them into big
products. He’s employing thousands of people to forge metal in American factories at a time when
this was thought to be impossible. Born in South Africa, Musk now looks like America’s most
innovative industrialist and outlandish thinker and the person most likely to set Silicon Valley on a
more ambitious course. Because of Musk, Americans could wake up in ten years with the most
modern highway in the world: a transit system run by thousands of solar-powered charging stations
and traversed by electric cars. By that time, SpaceX may well be sending up rockets every day, taking
people and things to dozens of habitats and making preparations for longer treks to Mars. These
advances are simultaneously difficult to fathom and seemingly inevitable if Musk can simply buy
enough time to make them work. As his ex-wife, Justine, put it, “He does what he wants, and he is
relentless about it. It’s Elon’s world, and the rest of us live in it.”

AFRICA
THE PUBLIC FIRST MET ELON REEVE MUSK IN 1984. The South African trade publication PC
and Of ice Technology published the source code to a video game Musk had designed. Called
Blastar, the science-fiction-inspired space game required 167 lines of instructions to run. This was
back in the day when early computer users were required to type out commands to make their
machines do much of anything. In that context, Musk’s game did not shine as a marvel of computer
science but it certainly surpassed what most twelve-year-olds were kicking out at the time. Its
coverage in the magazine netted Musk five hundred dollars and provided some early hints about his
character. The Blastar spread on page 69 of the magazine shows that the young man wanted to go by
the sci-fi-author-sounding name E. R. Musk and that he already had visions of grand conquests
dancing in his head. The brief explainer states, “In this game you have to destroy an alien space
freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes
good use of sprites and animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.” (As of this
writing, not even the Internet knows what “status beam machines” are.)
A boy fantasizing about space and battles between good and evil is anything but amazing. A boy
who takes these fantasies seriously is more remarkable. Such was the case with the young Elon Musk.
By the middle of his teenage years, Musk had blended fantasy and reality to the point that they were
hard to separate in his mind. Musk came to see man’s fate in the universe as a personal obligation. If
that meant pursuing cleaner energy technology or building spaceships to extend the human species’s
reach, then so be it. Musk would find a way to make these things happen. “Maybe I read too many
comics as a kid,” Musk said. “In the comics, it always seems like they are trying to save the world. It
seemed like one should try to make the world a better place because the inverse makes no sense.”
At around age fourteen, Musk had a full-on existential crisis. He tried to deal with it like many
gifted adolescents do, turning to religious and philosophical texts. Musk sampled a handful of
ideologies and then ended up more or less back where he had started, embracing the sci-fi lessons
found in one of the most influential books in his life: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by
Douglas Adams. “He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to
ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the
conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in
order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical
mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective
enlightenment,” he said.
It’s easy enough to spot some of the underpinnings of Musk’s search for purpose. Born in 1971, he
grew up in Pretoria, a large city in the northeastern part of South Africa, just an hour’s drive from
Johannesburg. The specter of apartheid was present throughout his childhood, as South Africa
frequently boiled over with tension and violence. Blacks and whites clashed, as did blacks of
different tribes. Musk turned four years old just days after the Soweto Uprising, in which hundreds of
black students died while protesting decrees of the white government. For years South Africa faced
sanctions imposed by other nations due to its racist policies. Musk had the luxury of traveling abroad
during his childhood and would have gotten a flavor for how outsiders viewed South Africa.
But what had even more of an impact on Musk’s personality was the white Afrikaner culture so
prevalent in Pretoria and the surrounding areas. Hypermasculine behavior was celebrated and tough
jocks were revered. While Musk enjoyed a level of privilege, he lived as an outsider whose reserved
personality and geeky inclinations ran against the prevailing attitudes of the time. His notion that
something about the world had gone awry received constant reinforcement, and Musk, almost from his
earliest days, plotted an escape from his surroundings and dreamed of a place that would allow his
personality and dreams to flourish. He saw America in its most clichéd form, as the land of
opportunity and the most likely stage for making the realization of his dreams possible. This is how it
came to pass that a lonesome, gawky South African boy who talked with the utmost sincerity about
pursuing “collective enlightenment” ended up as America’s most adventurous industrialist.
When Musk did finally reach the United States in his twenties, it marked a return to his ancestral
roots. Family trees suggest that ancestors bearing the Swiss German surname of Haldeman on the
maternal side of Musk’s family left Europe for New York during the Revolutionary War. From New
York, they spread out to the prairies of the Midwest—Illinois and Minnesota, in particular. “We had
people that fought on both sides of the Civil War apparently and were a family of farmers,” said Scott
Haldeman, Musk’s uncle and the unofficial family historian.
Throughout his childhood, boys teased Musk because of his unusual name. He earned the first part
of it from his great-grandfather John Elon Haldeman, who was born in 1872
1 and grew up in Illinois
before heading to Minnesota. There he would meet his wife, Almeda Jane Norman, who was five
years younger. By 1902, the couple had settled down in a log cabin in the central Minnesota town of
Pequot and given birth to their son Joshua Norman Haldeman, Musk’s grandfather. He would grow up
to become an eccentric and exceptional man and a model for Musk.*
Joshua Norman Haldeman is described as an athletic, self-reliant boy. In 1907, his family moved
to the prairies of Saskatchewan, and his father died shortly thereafter when Joshua was just seven,
leaving the boy to help run the house. He took to the wide-open land and picked up bronco horseback
riding, boxing, and wrestling. Haldeman would break in horses for local farmers, often hurting
himself in the process, and he organized one of Canada’s first rodeos. Family pictures show Joshua
dressed in a decorative pair of chaps demonstrating his rope-spinning skills. As a teenager, Haldeman
left home to get a degree from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Iowa and then returned to
Saskatchewan to become a farmer.
When the depression hit in the 1930s, Haldeman fell into a financial crisis. He could not afford to
keep up with bank loans on his equipment and had five thousand acres of land seized. “From then on,
Dad didn’t believe in banks or holding on to money,” said Scott Haldeman, who would go on to
receive his chiropractic degree from the same school as his father and become one of the world’s top
spinal pain experts. After losing the farm around 1934, Haldeman lived something of a nomadic
existence that his grandson would replicate in Canada decades later. Standing six feet, three inches,
he did odd jobs as a construction worker and rodeo performer before settling down as a
chiropractor.*
By 1948, Haldeman had married a Canadian dance studio instructor, Winnifred Josephine
Fletcher, or Wyn, and built a booming chiropractic practice. That year, the family, which already
included a son and a daughter, welcomed twin daughters Kaye and Maye, Musk’s mother. The
children lived in a three-story, twenty-room house that included a dance studio to let Wyn keep
teaching students. Ever in search of something new to do, Haldeman had picked up flying and bought
his own plane. The family gained some measure of notoriety as people heard about Haldeman and his
wife packing their kids into the back of the single-engine craft and heading off on excursions all
around North America. Haldeman would often show up at political and chiropractic meetings in the
plane and later wrote a book with his wife called The Flying Haldemans: Pity the Poor Private
Pilot.
Haldeman seemed to have everything going for him when, in 1950, he decided to give it all away.
The doctor-cum-politician had long railed against government interference in the lives of individuals
and had come to see the Canadian bureaucracy as too meddlesome. A man who forbade swearing,
smoking, Coca-Cola, and refined flour at his house, Haldeman contended that the moral character of
Canada had started to decline. Haldeman also possessed an enduring lust for adventure. And so, over
the course of a few months, the family sold their house and dance and chiropractic practices and
decided to move to South Africa—a place Haldeman had never been. Scott Haldeman remembers
helping his father disassemble the family’s Bellanca Cruisair (1948) airplane and put it into crates
before shipping it to Africa. Once in South Africa, the family rebuilt the plane and used it to scour the
country for a nice place to live, ultimately settling on Pretoria, where Haldeman set up a new
chiropractic practice.
The family’s spirit for adventure seemed to know no bounds. In 1952, Joshua and Wyn made a
22,000-mile round-trip journey in their plane, flying up through Africa to Scotland and Norway. Wyn
served as the navigator and, though not a licensed pilot, would sometimes take over the flying duties.
The couple topped this effort in 1954, flying 30,000 miles to Australia and back. Newspapers
reported on the couple’s trip, and they’re believed to be the only private pilots to get from Africa to
Australia in a single-engine plane.*
When not up in the air, the Haldemans were out in the bush going on great, monthlong expeditions
to find the Lost City of the Kalahari Desert, a supposed abandoned city in southern Africa. A family
photo from one of these excursions shows the five children in the middle of the African bush. They
have gathered around a large metal pot being warmed by the embers of a campfire. The children look
relaxed as they sit in folding chairs, legs crossed and reading books. Behind them is the ruby-red
Bellanca plane, a tent, and a car. The tranquility of the scene belies how dangerous these trips were.
During one incident, the family’s truck hit a tree stump and forced the bumper through the radiator.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means of communication, Joshua worked for three days to fix
the truck, while the family hunted for food. At other times, hyenas and leopards would circle the
campfire at night, and, one morning, the family woke to find a lion three feet away from their main
table. Joshua grabbed the first object he could find—a lamp—waved it, and told the lion to go away.
And it did.*
The Haldemans had a laissez-faire approach to raising their children, which would extend over
the generations to Musk. Their kids were never punished, as Joshua believed they would intuit their
way to proper behavior. When mom and dad went off on their tremendous flights, the kids were left at
home. Scott Haldeman can’t remember his father setting foot at his school a single time even though
his son was captain of the rugby team and a prefect. “To him, that was all just anticipated,” said Scott
Haldeman. “We were left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just have to
make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very proud of Elon.”
Haldeman died in 1974 at the age of seventy-two. He’d been doing practice landings in his plane
and didn’t see a wire attached to a pair of poles. The wire caught the plane’s wheels and flipped the
craft, and Haldeman broke his neck. Elon was a toddler at the time. But throughout his childhood,
Elon heard many stories about his grandfather’s exploits and sat through countless slide shows that
documented his travels and trips through the bush. “My grandmother told these tales of how they
almost died several times along their journeys,” Musk said. “They were flying in a plane with
literally no instruments—not even a radio, and they had road maps instead of aerial maps, and some
of those weren’t even correct. My grandfather had this desire for adventure, exploration doing crazy
things.” Elon buys into the idea that his unusual tolerance for risk may well have been inherited
directly from his grandfather. Many years after the last slide show, Elon tried to find and purchase the
red Bellanca plane but could not locate it.
Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, grew up idolizing her parents. In her youth, she was considered a
nerd. She liked math and science and did well at the coursework. By the age of fifteen, however,
people had taken notice of some of her other attributes. Maye was gorgeous. Tall with ash-blond hair,
Maye had the high cheekbones and angular features that would make her stand out anywhere. A friend
of the family ran a modeling school, and Maye took some courses. On the weekends, she did runway
shows, magazine shoots, occasionally showed up at a senator’s or ambassador’s home for an event,
and ended up as a finalist for Miss South Africa. (Maye has continued to model into her sixties,
appearing on the covers of magazines like New York and Elle and in Beyoncé’s music videos.)
Maye and Elon’s father, Errol Musk, grew up in the same neighborhood. They met for the first
time when Maye, born in 1948, was about eleven. Errol was the cool kid to Maye’s nerd but had a
crush on her for years. “He fell in love with me because of my legs and my teeth,” said Maye. The
two would date on and off throughout their time at university. And, according to Maye, Errol spent
about seven years as a relentless suitor seeking her hand in marriage and eventually breaking her will.
“He just never stopped proposing,” she said.
Their marriage was complicated from the start. Maye became pregnant during the couple’s
honeymoon and gave birth to Elon on June 28, 1971, nine months and two days after her wedding day.
While they may not have enjoyed marital bliss, the couple carved out a decent life for themselves in
Pretoria. Errol worked as a mechanical and electrical engineer and handled large projects such as
office buildings, retail complexes, residential subdivisions, and an air force base, while Maye set up
a practice as a dietician. A bit more than a year after Elon’s birth came his brother Kimbal, and soon
thereafter came their sister Tosca.
Elon exhibited all the traits of a curious, energetic tot. He picked things up easily, and Maye, like
many mothers do, pegged her son as brilliant and precocious. “He seemed to understand things
quicker than the other kids,” she said. The perplexing thing was that Elon seemed to drift off into a
trance at times. People spoke to him, but nothing got through when he had a certain, distant look in his
eyes. This happened so often that Elon’s parents and doctors thought he might be deaf. “Sometimes, he
just didn’t hear you,” said Maye. Doctors ran a series of tests on Elon, and elected to remove his
adenoid glands, which can improve hearing in children. “Well, it didn’t change,” said Maye. Elon’s
condition had far more to do with the wiring of his mind than how his auditory system functioned. “He
goes into his brain, and then you just see he is in another world,” Maye said. “He still does that. Now
I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something.”
Other children did not respond well to these dreamlike states. You could do jumping jacks right
beside Musk or yell at him, and he would not even notice. He kept right on thinking, and those around
him judged that he was either rude or really weird. “I do think Elon was always a little different but
in a nerdy way,” Maye said. “It didn’t endear him to his peers.”
For Musk, these pensive moments were wonderful. At five and six, he had found a way to block
out the world and dedicate all of his concentration to a single task. Part of this ability stemmed from
the very visual way in which Musk’s mind worked. He could see images in his mind’s eye with a
clarity and detail that we might associate today with an engineering drawing produced by computer
software. “It seems as though the part of the brain that’s usually reserved for visual processing—the
part that is used to process images coming in from my eyes—gets taken over by internal thought
processes,” Musk said. “I can’t do this as much now because there are so many things demanding my
attention but, as a kid, it happened a lot. That large part of your brain that’s used to handle incoming
images gets used for internal thinking.” Computers split their hardest jobs between two types of chips.
There are graphics chips that deal with processing the images produced by a television show stream
or video game and computational chips that handle general purpose tasks and mathematical
operations. Over time, Musk has ended up thinking that his brain has the equivalent of a graphics chip.
It allows him to see things out in the world, replicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might
change or behave when interacting with other objects. “For images and numbers, I can process their
interrelationships and algorithmic relationships,” Musk said. “Acceleration, momentum, kinetic
energy—how those sorts of things will be affected by objects comes through very vividly.”
The most striking part of Elon’s character as a young boy was his compulsion to read. From a
very young age, he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times. “It was not unusual for him to read
ten hours a day,” said Kimbal. “If it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a day.” The
family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they realized mid-trip that Elon had gone
missing. Maye or Kimbal would pop into the nearest bookstore and find Elon somewhere near the
back sitting on the floor and reading in one of his trancelike states.
As Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school ended at 2 P.M. and stay
there until about 6 P.M., when his parents returned home from work. He plowed through fiction books
and then comics and then nonfiction titles. “Sometimes they kicked me out of the store, but usually
not,” Elon said. He listed The Lord of the Rings, Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, and Robert
Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress as some of his favorites, alongside The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy. “At one point, I ran out of books to read at the school library and the
neighborhood library,” Musk said. “This is maybe the third or fourth grade. I tried to convince the
librarian to order books for me. So then, I started to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was so
helpful. You don’t know what you don’t know. You realize there are all these things out there.”
Elon, in fact, churned through two sets of encyclopedias—a feat that did little to help him make
friends. The boy had a photographic memory, and the encyclopedias turned him into a fact factory. He
came off as a classic know-it-all. At the dinner table, Tosca would wonder aloud about the distance
from Earth to the Moon. Elon would spit out the exact measurement at perigee and apogee. “If we had
a question, Tosca would always say, ‘Just ask genius boy,’” Maye said. “We could ask him about
anything. He just remembered it.” Elon cemented his bookworm reputation through his clumsy ways.
“He’s not very sporty,” said Maye.
Maye tells the story of Elon playing outside one night with his siblings and cousins. When one of
them complained of being frightened by the dark, Elon pointed out that “dark is merely the absence of
light,” which did little to reassure the scared child. As a youngster, Elon’s constant yearning to
correct people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his feelings of isolation. Elon
genuinely thought that people would be happy to hear about the flaws in their thinking. “Kids don’t
like answers like that,” said Maye. “They would say, ‘Elon, we are not playing with you anymore.’ I
felt very sad as a mother because I think he wanted friends. Kimbal and Tosca would bring home
friends, and Elon wouldn’t, and he would want to play with them. But he was awkward, you know.”
Maye urged Kimbal and Tosca to include Elon. They responded as kids will. “But Mom, he’s not
fun.” As he got older, however, Elon would have strong, affectionate attachments to his siblings and
cousins—his mother’s sister’s sons. Though he kept to himself at school, Elon had an outgoing nature
with members of his family and eventually took on the role of elder and chief instigator among them.
For a while, life inside the Musk household was quite good. The family owned one of the biggest
houses in Pretoria thanks to the success of Errol’s engineering business. There’s a portrait of the three
Musk children taken when Elon was about eight years old that shows three blond, fit children sitting
next to each other on a brick porch with Pretoria’s famous purple jacaranda trees in the background.
Elon has large, rounded cheeks and a broad smile.
Then, not long after the photo was taken, the family fell apart. His parents separated and divorced
within the year. Maye moved with the kids to the family’s holiday home in Durban, on South Africa’s
eastern coast. After a couple of years of this arrangement, Elon decided he wanted to live with his
father. “My father seemed sort of sad and lonely, and my mom had three kids, and he didn’t have any,”
Musk said. “It seemed unfair.” Some members of Musk’s family have bought into this idea that Elon’s
logical nature propelled him, while others claim that his father’s mother, Cora, exerted a lot of
pressure on the boy. “I could not understand why he would leave this happy home I made for him—
this really happy home,” said Maye. “But Elon is his own person.” Justine Musk, Elon’s ex-wife and
the mother of his five boys, theorized that Elon identified more with the alpha male of the house and
wasn’t bothered by the emotional aspect of the decision. “I don’t think he was particularly close with
either parent,” Justine said, while describing the Musk clan overall as being cool and the opposite of
doting. Kimbal later opted to live with Errol as well, saying simply that by nature a son wants to live
with his father.
Whenever the topic of Errol arrives, members of Elon’s family clam up. They’re in agreement that
he is not a pleasant man to be around but have declined to elaborate. Errol has since been remarried,
and Elon has two, younger half sisters of whom he’s quite protective. Elon and his siblings seem
determined not to bad-mouth Errol publicly, so as not to upset the sisters.
The basics are as follows: Errol’s side of the family has deep South African roots. The Musk clan
can trace its presence in the country back about two hundred years and claim an entry in Pretoria’s
first phone book. Errol’s father, Walter Henry James Musk, was an army sergeant. “I remember him
almost never talking,” Elon said. “He would just drink whiskey and be grumpy and was very good at
doing crossword puzzles.” Cora Amelia Musk, Errol’s mother, was born in England to a family famed
for its intellectual genes. She embraced both the spotlight and her grandchildren. “Our grandmother
had this very dominant personality and was quite an enterprising woman,” said Kimbal. “She was a
very big influence in our lives.” Elon considered his relationship with Cora—or Nana, as he called
her—particularly tight. “After the divorce, she took care of me quite a lot,” he said. “She would pick
me up from school, and I would hang out with her playing Scrabble and that type of thing.”
On the surface, life at Errol’s house seemed grand. He had plenty of books for Elon to read from
cover to cover and money to buy a computer and other objects that Elon desired. Errol took his
children on numerous trips overseas. “It was an amazingly fun time,” said Kimbal. “I have a lot of fun
memories from that.” Errol also impressed the kids with his intellect and dealt out some practical
lessons. “He was a talented engineer,” Elon said. “He knew how every physical object worked.”
Both Elon and Kimbal were required to go to the sites of Errol’s engineering jobs and learn how to
lay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, and put in electrical wiring. “There were fun moments,”
Elon said.
Errol was what Kimbal described as “ultra-present and very intense.” He would sit Elon and
Kimbal down and lecture at them for three to four hours without the boys being able to respond. He
seemed to delight in being hard on the boys and sucked the fun out of common childhood diversions.
From time to time, Elon tried to convince his dad to move to America and often talked about his
intentions to live in the United States later in life. Errol countered such dreams by trying to teach Elon
a lesson. He sent the housekeepers away and had Elon do all the chores to let him know what it was
like “to play American.”
While Elon and Kimbal declined to provide an exact recounting, they clearly experienced
something awful and profound during those years with their father. They both talk about having to
endure some form of psychological torture. “He definitely has serious chemical stuff,” said Kimbal.
“Which I am sure Elon and I have inherited. It was a very emotionally challenging upbringing, but it
made us who we are today.” Maye bristled when the subject of Errol came up. “Nobody gets along
with him,” she said. “He is not nice to anyone. I don’t want to tell stories because they are
horrendous. You know, you just don’t talk about it. There are kids and grandkids involved.”
When asked to chat about Elon, Errol responded via e-mail: “Elon was a very independent and
focused child at home with me. He loved computer science before anyone even knew what it was in
South Africa and his ability was widely recognized by the time he was 12 years old. Elon and his
brother Kimbal’s activities as children and young men were so many and varied that it’s difficult to
name just one, as they travelled together with me extensively in S. Africa and the world at large,
visiting all the continents regularly from the age of six onwards. Elon and his brother and sister were
and continue to be exemplary, in every way a father could want. I’m very proud of what Elon’s
accomplished.”
Errol copied Elon on this e-mail, and Elon warned me off corresponding with his father, insisting
that his father’s take on past events could not be trusted. “He is an odd duck,” Musk said. But, when
pressed for more information, Musk dodged. “It would certainly be accurate to say that I did not have
a good childhood,” he said. “It may sound good. It was not absent of good, but it was not a happy
childhood. It was like misery. He’s good at making life miserable—that’s for sure. He can take any
situation no matter how good it is and make it bad. He’s not a happy man. I don’t know . . . fuck . . . I
don’t know how someone becomes like he is. It would just cause too much trouble to tell you any
more.” Elon and Justine have vowed that their children will not be allowed to meet Errol.
When Elon was nearly ten years old, he saw a computer for the first time, at the Sandton City
Mall in Johannesburg. “There was an electronics store that mostly did hi-fi-type stuff, but then, in one
corner, they started stocking a few computers,” Musk said. He felt awed right away—“It was like,
‘Whoa. Holy shit!’”—by this machine that could be programmed to do a person’s bidding. “I had to
have that and then hounded my father to get the computer,” Musk said. Soon he owned a Commodore
VIC-20, a popular home machine that went on sale in 1980. Elon’s computer arrived with five
kilobytes of memory and a workbook on the BASIC programming language. “It was supposed to take
like six months to get through all the lessons,” Elon said. “I just got super OCD on it and stayed up for
three days with no sleep and did the entire thing. It seemed like the most super-compelling thing I had
ever seen.” Despite being an engineer, Musk’s father was something of a Luddite and dismissive of
the machine. Elon recounted that “he said it was just for games and that you’d never be able to do real
engineering on it. I just said, ‘Whatever.’”
While bookish and into his new computer, Elon quite often led Kimbal and his cousins (Kaye’s
children) Russ, Lyndon, and Peter Rive on adventures. They dabbled one year in selling Easter eggs
door-to-door in the neighborhood. The eggs were not well decorated, but the boys still marked them
up a few hundred percent for their wealthy neighbors. Elon also spearheaded their work with
homemade explosives and rockets. South Africa did not have the Estes rocket kits popular among
hobbyists, so Elon would create his own chemical compounds and put them inside of canisters. “It is
remarkable how many things you can get to explode,” Elon said. “Saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal are
the basic ingredients for gunpowder, and then if you combine a strong acid with a strong alkaline, that
will generally release a lot of energy. Granulated chlorine with brake fluid—that’s quite impressive.
I’m lucky I have all my fingers.” When not handling explosives, the boys put on layers of clothing and
goggles and shot each other with pellet guns. Elon and Kimbal raced dirt bikes against each other in
sandlots until Kimbal flew off his bike one day and hurtled into a barbed wire fence.
As the years went on, the cousins took their entrepreneurial pursuits more seriously, even
attempting at one point to start a video arcade. Without any parents knowing, the boys picked out a
spot for their arcade, got a lease, and started navigating the permit process for their business.
Eventually, they had to get someone over eighteen to sign a legal document, and neither the Rives’
father nor Errol would oblige. It would take a couple of decades, but Elon and the Rives would
eventually go into business together.
The boys’ most audacious exploits may have been their trips between Pretoria and Johannesburg.
During the 1980s, South Africa could be a terribly violent place, and the thirty-five-mile train trip
linking Pretoria and Johannesburg stood out as one of the world’s more dangerous rides. Kimbal
counted the train journeys as formative experiences for him and Elon. “South Africa was not a happygo-lucky place, and that has an impact on you. We saw some really rough stuff. It was part of an
atypical upbringing—just this insane set of experiences that changes how you view risk. You don’t
grow up thinking getting a job is the hard part. That’s not interesting enough.”
The boys ranged in age from about thirteen to sixteen and chased a mix of parties and geeky
exploits in Johannesburg. During one jaunt, they went to a Dungeons & Dragons tournament. “That
was us being nerd master supremes,” Musk said. All of the boys were into the role-playing game,
which requires someone to help set the mood for a contest by imagining and then describing a scene.
“You have entered a room, and there is a chest in the corner. What will you do? . . . You open the
chest. You’ve sprung a trap. Dozens of goblins are on the loose.” Elon excelled at this Dungeon
Master role and had memorized the texts detailing the powers of monsters and other characters.
“Under Elon’s leadership, we played the role so well and won the tournament,” said Peter Rive.
“Winning requires this incredible imagination, and Elon really set the tone for keeping people
captivated and inspired.”
The Elon that his peers encountered at school was far less inspirational. Throughout middle and
high school, Elon bounced around a couple of institutions. He spent the equivalent of eighth and ninth
grades at Bryanston High School. One afternoon Elon and Kimbal were sitting at the top of a flight of
concrete stairs eating when a boy decided to go after Elon. “I was basically hiding from this gang that
was fucking hunting me down for God knows fucking why. I think I accidentally bumped this guy at
assembly that morning and he’d taken some huge offense at that.” The boy crept up behind Musk,
kicked him in the head, and then shoved him down the stairs. Musk tumbled down the entire flight, and
a handful of boys pounced on him, some of them kicking Musk in the side and the ringleader bashing
his head against the ground. “They were a bunch of fucking psychos,” Musk said. “I blacked out.”
Kimbal watched in horror and feared for Elon’s life. He rushed down the stairs to find Elon’s face
bloodied and swollen. “He looked like someone who had just been in the boxing ring,” Kimbal said.
Elon then went to the hospital. “It was about a week before I could get back to school,” Musk said.
(During a news conference in 2013, Elon disclosed that he’d had a nose job to deal with the lingering
effects of this beating.)
For three or four years, Musk endured relentless hounding at the hands of these bullies. They went
so far as to beat up a boy that Musk considered his best friend until the child agreed to stop hanging
out with Musk. “Moreover, they got him—they got my best fucking friend—to lure me out of hiding so
they could beat me up,” Musk said. “And that fucking hurt.” While telling this part of the story, Musk’s
eyes welled up and his voice quivered. “For some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were
going to go after me nonstop. That’s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years, there was
no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the shit out of me, and then I’d
come home, and it would just be awful there as well. It was just like nonstop horrible.”
Musk spent the latter stages of his high school career at Pretoria Boys High School, where a
growth spurt and the generally better behavior of the students made life more bearable. While a
public school by definition, Pretoria Boys has functioned more like a private school for the last
hundred years. It’s the place you send a young man to get him ready to attend Oxford or Cambridge.
The boys from Musk’s class remember him as a likable, quiet, unspectacular student. “There were
four or five boys that were considered the very brightest,” said Deon Prinsloo, who sat behind Elon
in some classes. “Elon was not one of them.” Such comments were echoed by a half dozen boys who
also noted that Musk’s lack of interest in sports left him isolated in the midst of an athletics-obsessed
culture. “Honestly, there were just no signs that he was going to be a billionaire,” said Gideon Fourie,
another classmate. “He was never in a leadership position at school. I was rather surprised to see
what has happened to him.”
While Musk didn’t have any close friends at school, his eccentric interests did leave an
impression. One boy—Ted Wood—remembered Musk bringing model rockets to school and blasting
them off during breaks. This was not the only hint of his aspirations. During a science-class debate,
Elon gained attention for railing against fossil fuels in favor of solar power—an almost sacrilegious
stance in a country devoted to mining the earth’s natural resources. “He always had firm views on
things,” said Wood. Terency Beney, a classmate who stayed in touch with Elon over the years,
claimed that Musk had started fantasizing about colonizing other planets in high school as well.
In another nod to the future, Elon and Kimbal were chatting during a class break outdoors when
Wood interrupted them and asked what they were going on about. “They said, ‘We are talking about
whether there is a need for branch banking in the financial industry and whether we will move to
paperless banking.’ I remember thinking that was such an absurd comment to make. I said, ‘Yeah,
that’s great.’”*
While Musk might not have been among the academic elite in his class, he was among a handful of
students with the grades and self-professed interest to be selected for an experimental computer
program. Students were plucked out of a number of schools and brought together to learn the BASIC,
COBOL, and Pascal programming languages. Musk continued to augment these technological leanings
with his love of science fiction and fantasy and tried his hand at writing stories that involved dragons
and supernatural beings. “I wanted to write something like Lord of the Rings,” he said.
Maye viewed these high school years through a mother’s eyes and recounted plenty of tales of
Musk performing spectacular academic feats. The video game he wrote, she said, impressed much
older, more experienced techies. He aced math exams well beyond his years. And he had that
incredible memory. The only reason he did not outrank the other boys was a lack of interest in the
work prescribed by the school.
As Musk saw it, “I just look at it as ‘What grades do I need to get where I want to go?’ There
were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just didn’t see the point of learning that. It seemed
ridiculous. I’d get a passing grade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers—I got the
highest grade you can get in those. There needs to be a reason for a grade. I’d rather play video
games, write software, and read books than try and get an A if there’s no point in getting an A. I can
remember failing subjects in like fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother’s boyfriend told me I’d be
held back if I didn’t pass. I didn’t actually know you had to pass the subjects to move to the next
grade. I got the best grades in class after that.”
At seventeen, Musk left South Africa for Canada. He has recounted this journey quite often in the
press and typically leans on two descriptions of the motivation for his flight. The short version is that
Musk wanted to get to the United States as quickly as possible and could use Canada as a pit stop via
his Canadian ancestry. The second go-to story that Musk relies on has more of a social conscience.
South Africa required military service at the time. Musk wanted to avoid joining the military, he has
said, because it would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime.
What rarely gets mentioned is that Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months before
heading off on his grand adventure. He began pursuing physics and engineering but put lackluster
effort into the work and soon dropped out of school. Musk characterized the time at university as just
something to do while he awaited his Canadian documentation. In addition to being an
inconsequential part of his life, Musk lazing through school to avoid South Africa’s required military
service rather undermines the tale of a brooding, adventurous youth that he likes to tell, which is
likely why the stint at the University of Pretoria never seems to come up.
There’s no question, though, that Musk had been pining to get to the United States on a visceral
level for a long time. Musk’s early inclination toward computers and technology had fostered an
intense interest in Silicon Valley, and his trips overseas had reinforced the idea that America was the
place to get things done. South Africa, by contrast, presented far less opportunity for an
entrepreneurial soul. As Kimbal put it, “South Africa was like a prison for someone like Elon.”
Musk’s opportunity to flee arrived with a change in the law that allowed Maye to pass her
Canadian citizenship to her children. Musk immediately began researching how to complete the
paperwork for this process. It took about a year to receive the approvals from the Canadian
government and to secure a Canadian passport. “That’s when Elon said, ‘I’m leaving for Canada,’”
Maye said. In these pre-Internet days, Musk had to wait three agonizing weeks to get a plane ticket.
Once it arrived, and without flinching, he left home for good.

CANADA
MUSK’S GREAT ESCAPE TO CANADA WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT. He knew of a
great-uncle in Montreal, hopped on a flight and hoped for the best. Upon landing in June 1988, Musk
found a pay phone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle. When that didn’t work, he
called his mother collect. She had bad news. Maye had sent a letter to the uncle before Musk left and
received a reply while her son was in transit. The uncle had gone to Minnesota, meaning Musk had
nowhere to stay. Bags in hand, Musk headed for a youth hostel.
After spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city, Musk tried to come up with a long-term
plan. Maye had family scattered all across Canada, and Musk began reaching out to them. He bought a
countrywide bus ticket that let him hop on and off it  be a damaged, James Dean sort. As fortune would
have it, however, the clean-cut, posh-sounding Musk spotted Wilson on campus and went right to
work trying to date her. “She looked pretty great,” Musk said. “She was also smart and this
intellectual with sort of an edge. She had a black belt in tae kwon do and was semi-bohemian and,
you know, like the hot chick on campus.” He made his first move just outside of her dorm, where he
pretended to have bumped into her by accident and then reminded her that they had met previously at
a party. Justine, only one week into school, agreed to Musk’s proposal of an ice cream date. When he
arrived to pick up Wilson, Musk found a note on the dorm room door, notifying him that he’d been
stood up. “It said that she had to go study for an exam and couldn’t make it and that she was sorry,”
Musk said. Musk then hunted down Justine’s best friend and did some research, asking where Justine
usually studied and what her favorite flavor of ice cream was. Later, as Justine hid in the student
center studying Spanish, Musk appeared behind her with a couple of melting chocolate chip ice cream
cones in hand.
Wilson had dreamed of having a torrid romance with a writer. “I wanted to be Sylvia and Ted,”
she said. What she fell for instead was a relentless, ambitious geek. The pair attended the same
abnormal-psychology class and compared their grades following an exam. Justine notched a 97, Musk
a 98. “He went back to the professor, and talked his way into the two points he lost and got a
hundred,” Justine said. “It felt like we were always competing.” Musk had a romantic side as well.
One time he sent Wilson a dozen roses, each with its own note, and he also gifted Wilson a copy of
The Prophet filled with handwritten romantic musings. “He can sweep you off your feet,” Justine
said.
During their university years, the two youngsters were off and on, with Musk having to work hard
to keep the relationship going. “She was hip and dated the coolest guys and wasn’t interested in Elon
at all,” Maye said. “So that was hard on him.” Musk pursued a couple of other girls, but kept
returning to Justine. Any time she acted cool toward him, Musk responded with his usual show of
force. “He would call very insistently,” she said. “You always knew it was Elon because the phone
would never stop ringing. The man does not take no for an answer. You can’t blow him off. I do think
of him as the Terminator. He locks his gaze on to something and says, ‘It shall be mine.’ Bit by bit, he
won me over.”
College suited Musk. He worked on being less of a know-it-all, while also finding a group of
people who respected his intellectual abilities. The university students were less inclined to laugh off
or deride his opinionated takes on energy, space, and whatever else was captivating him at the
moment. Musk had found people who responded to his ambition rather than mocking it, and he fed on
this environment.
Navaid Farooq, a Canadian who grew up in Geneva, ended up in Musk’s freshman-year
dormitory in the fall of 1990. Both men were placed in the international section where a Canadian
student would get paired with a student from overseas. Musk sort of broke the system, since he
technically counted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings. “I had a roommate
from Hong Kong, and he was a really nice guy,” Musk said. “He religiously attended every lecture,
which was helpful, since I went to the least number of classes possible.” For a time, Musk sold
computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. “I could build something to suit
their needs like a tricked-out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what
they could get in a store,” Musk said. “Or if their computer didn’t boot properly or had a virus, I’d fix
it. I could pretty much solve any problem.” Farooq and Musk bonded over their backgrounds living
abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games. “I don’t think he makes friends easily, but he is
very loyal to those he has,” Farooq said. When the video game Civilization was released, the college
chums spent hours building their empire, much to the dismay of Farooq’s girlfriend, who was
forgotten in another room. “Elon could lose himself for hours on end,” Farooq said. The students also
relished their loner lifestyles. “We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not
feel awkward,” Farooq said. “We can think to ourselves and not feel socially weird about it.”
Musk was more ambitious in college than he’d been in high school. He studied business,
competed in public speaking contests, and began to display the brand of intensity and competitiveness
that marks his behavior today. After one economics exam, Musk, Farooq, and some other students in
class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to ascertain how well they did on the
test. It soon became clear that Musk had a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else. “This was a
group of fairly high achievers, and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve,” Farooq said. Musk’s
intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship. “When Elon gets into something, he
develops just this different level of interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon
from the rest of humanity.”
In 1992, having spent two years at Queen’s, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on
a scholarship. Musk saw the Ivy League school as possibly opening some additional doors and went
off in pursuit of dual degrees—first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then a
bachelor’s degree in physics. Justine stayed at Queen’s, pursuing her dream of becoming a writer, and
maintained a long-distance relationship with Musk. Now and again, she would visit him, and the two
would sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend.
Musk blossomed even more at Penn, and really started to feel comfortable while hanging out with
his fellow physics students. “At Penn, he met people that thought like him,” Maye said. “There were
some nerds there. He so enjoyed them. I remember going for lunch with them, and they were talking
physics things. They were saying, ‘A plus B equals pi squared’ or whatever. They would laugh out
loud. It was cool to see him so happy.” Once again, however, Musk did not make many friends among
the broader school body. It’s difficult to find former students who remember him being there at all.
But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi, who would go on to be a Silicon Valley
entrepreneur in his own right and is to this day as tight with Elon as anyone.
Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air. He was the artistic,
colorful foil to the studious, more buttoned-up Musk. Both of the young men were transfer students
and ended up being placed in the funky freshman dorm. The lackluster social scene did not live up to
Ressi’s expectations, and he talked Musk into renting a large house off campus. They got the tenbedroom home relatively cheap, since it was a frat house that had gone unrented. During the week,
Musk and Ressi would study, but as the weekend approached, Ressi, in particular, would transform
the house into a nightclub. He covered the windows with trash bags to make it pitch black inside and
decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever objects he could find. “It was a full-out,
unlicensed speakeasy,” Ressi said. “We would have as many as five hundred people. We would
charge five dollars, and it would be pretty much all you could drink—beer and Jell-O shots and other
things.”
Come Friday night, the ground around the house would shake from the intensity of the bass being
pumped out by Ressi’s speakers. Maye visited one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had
hammered objects into the walls and lacquered them with glow-in-the-dark paint. She ended up
working the door as the coat check/money taker and grabbed a pair of scissors for protection as the
cash piled up in a shoe box.
A second house had fourteen rooms. Musk, Ressi, and one other person lived there. They
fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs and came up with other makeshift furniture
ideas. Musk returned home one day to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted
it in Day-Glo colors. Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down, painting it black, and studying. “I’m
like, ‘Dude, that’s installation art in our party house,’” said Ressi. Remind Musk of this incident and
he’ll respond matter-of-factly, “It was a desk.”
Musk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke, but he’s not a big drinker and does not really
care for the taste of alcohol. “Somebody had to stay sober during these parties,” Musk said. “I was
paying my own way through college and could make an entire month’s rent in one night. Adeo was in
charge of doing cool shit around the house, and I would run the party.” As Ressi put it, “Elon was the
most straight-laced dude you have ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally
nothing.” The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk’s behavior came during video game
binges that could go on for days.
Musk’s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways to harness energy
expanded at Penn. In December 1994, he had to come up with a business plan for one of his classes
and ended up writing a paper titled “The Importance of Being Solar.” The document started with a bit
of Musk’s wry sense of humor. At the top of the page, he wrote: “The sun will come out tomorrow. . .
.”—Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable energy. The paper went on to predict a rise in
solar power technology based on materials improvements and the construction of large-scale solar
plants. Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds that can make them
more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing of the “power station of the future.” It
depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in space—each four kilometers in width—sending their juice
down to Earth via microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven-kilometer diameter. Musk
received a 98 on what his professor deemed a “very interesting and well written paper.”
A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and electronically scanning
them, performing optical character recognition, and putting all of the information in a single database
—much like a mix between today’s Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper dwelled on
another of Musk’s favorite topics—ultracapacitors. In the forty-four-page document, Musk is plainly
jubilant over the idea of a new form of energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars,
planes, and rockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley, he wrote:
“The end result represents the first new means of storing significant amounts of electrical energy
since the development of the battery and fuel cell. Furthermore, because the Ultracapacitor retains the
basic properties of a capacitor, it can deliver its energy over one hundred times faster than a battery
of equivalent weight, and be recharged just as quickly.” Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise
for “a very thorough analysis” with “excellent financials!”
The remarks from the professor were spot-on. Musk’s clear, concise writing is the work of a
logician, moving from one point to the next with precision. What truly stood out, though, was Musk’s
ability to master difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then, he showed
an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a scientific advance to a for-profit enterprise.
As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after college, he briefly
considered getting into the videogame business. He’d been obsessed with video games since his
childhood and had held a gaming internship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a
pursuit. “I really like computer games, but then if I made really great computer games, how much
effect would that have on the world,” he said. “It wouldn’t have a big effect. Even though I have an
intrinsic love of video games, I couldn’t bring myself to do that as a career.”
In interviews, Musk often makes sure that people know he had some truly big ideas on his mind
 of his life. As he tells it, he would daydream at Queen’s and Penn and usually end
ed the Internet, renewable energy, and space as the three areas
that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the markets where he could make a
big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in all three. “I told all my ex-girlfriends and my ex-wife
about these ideas,” he said. “It probably sounded like super-crazy talk.”
Musk’s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for electric cars, solar energy, and
rockets can come off as insecure. It feels as if Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way.
But for Musk, the distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is important. Musk
has long wanted the world to know that he’s different from the run-of-the-mill entrepreneur in Silicon
Valley. He wasn’t just sniffing out trends, and he wasn’t consumed by the idea of getting rich. He’s
been in pursuit of a master plan all along. “I really was thinking about this stuff in college,” he said.
“It is not some invented story after the fact. I don’t want to seem like a Johnny-come-lately or that I’m
chasing a fad or just being opportunistic. I’m not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I
think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.”

ELON’S FIRST START-UP
IN THE SUMMER OF 1994, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, took their first steps toward becoming
honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a road trip across the country.
Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and done well for himself,
running what amounted to a small business. He sold off his part of the franchise and pooled the money
with what Musk had on hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near
San Francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part of the drive took them
down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree
weather in a car with no air-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl’s Jr. burger joints,
where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.
The trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty-something hijinks and raging capitalist
daydreaming. The Web had just started to become accessible to the public thanks to the rise of
directory sites like Yahoo! and tools like Netscape’s browser. The brothers were tuned in to the
Internet and thought they might like to start a company together doing something on the Web. From
California to Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming,
and talking shit before heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to arise from
the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn’t meant to be something as ambitious as
electronic health records but more of a system for physicians to exchange information and
collaborate. “It seemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted,” Kimbal said. “I
went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of it later, but it didn’t fly. We didn’t
love it.”
Musk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley, holding down a pair of
internships. By day, he worked at Pinnacle Research Institute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a
much-ballyhooed start-up with a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be
used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybrid vehicles. The work also veered—at least
conceptually—into more bizarre territory. Musk could talk at length about how ultracapacitors might
be used to build laser-based sidearms in the tradition of Star Wars and just about any other futuristic
film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy, and then the shooter would replace an
ultracapacitor at the base of the gun, much like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away
again. Ultracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies for missiles. They were more
resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a launch and would hold a more consistent
charge over long periods of time. Musk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as
the basis for some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist fantasies.
In the evenings, Musk headed to Rocket Science Games, a start-up based in Palo Alto that wanted
to create the most advanced video games ever made by moving them off cartridges and onto CDs that
could hold more information. The CDs would in theory allow them to bring Hollywood-style
storytelling and production quality to the games. A team of budding all-stars who were a mix of
engineers and film people was assembled to pull off the work. Tony Fadell, who would later drive
much of the development of both the iPod and iPhone at Apple, worked at Rocket Science, as did the
guys who developed the QuickTime multimedia software for Apple. They also had people who
worked on the original Star Wars effects at Industrial Light & Magic and some who did games at
LucasArts Entertainment. Rocket Science gave Musk a flavor for what Silicon Valley had to offer
both from a talent and culture perspective. There were people working at the office twenty-four hours
a day, and they didn’t think it at all odd that Musk would turn up around 5 P.M. every evening to start
his second job. “We brought him in to write some very menial low-level code,” said Peter Barrett, an
Australian engineer who helped start the company. “He was completely unflappable. After a short
while, I don’t think anyone was giving him any direction, and he ended up making what he wanted to
make.”
Specifically, Musk had been asked to write the drivers that would let joysticks and mice
communicate with various computers and games. Drivers are the same types of annoying files that you
have to install to get a printer or camera working with a home computer—true grunt work. A selftaught programmer, Musk fancied himself quite good at coding and assigned himself to more
ambitious jobs. “I was basically trying to figure out how you could multitask stuff, so you could read
video from a CD, while running a game at the same time,” Musk said. “At the time, you could do one
or the other. It was this complicated bit of assembly programming.” Complicated indeed. Musk had to
issue commands that spoke directly to a computer’s main microprocessor and fiddled with the most
basic functions that made the machine work. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple’s
QuickTime, had overseen the hiring of Musk and marveled at his ability to pull all-nighters. “He had
boundless energy,” Leak said. “Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but
he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”
Musk found in Silicon Valley a wealth of the opportunity he’d been seeking and a place equal to
his ambitions. He would return two summers in a row and then bolt west permanently after graduating
with dual degrees from Penn. He initially intended to pursue a doctorate in materials science and
physics at Stanford and to advance the work he’d done at Pinnacle on ultracapacitors. As the story
goes, Musk dropped out of Stanford after two days, finding the Internet’s call irresistible. He talked
Kimbal into moving to Silicon Valley as well, so they could conquer the Web together.
The first inklings of a viable Internet business had come to Musk during his internships. A
salesperson from the Yellow Pages had come into one of the start-up offices. He tried to sell the idea
of an online listing to complement the regular listing a company would have in the big, fat Yellow
Pages book. The salesman struggled with his pitch and clearly had little grasp of what the Internet
actually was or how someone would find a business on it. The flimsy pitch got Musk thinking, and he
reached out to Kimbal, talking up the idea of helping businesses get online for the first time.
“Elon said, ‘These guys don’t know what they are talking about. Maybe this is something we can
do,’” Kimbal said. This was 1995, and the brothers were about to form Global Link Information
Network, a start-up that would eventually be renamed Zip2. (For details on the controversy
surrounding Zip2’s founding and Musk’s academic record, see Appendix 1.)
The Zip2 idea was ingenious. Few small businesses in 1995 understood the ramifications of the
Internet. They had little idea how to get on it and didn’t really see the value in creating a website for
their business or even in having a Yellow Pages–like listing online. Musk and his brother hoped to
convince restaurants, clothing shops, hairdressers, and the like that the time had come for them to
make their presence known to the Web-surfing public. Zip2 would create a searchable directory of
businesses and tie this into maps. Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that
everyone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza parlor and the turn-by-turn
directions to get there. This may seem obvious today—think Yelp meets Google Maps—but back
then, not even stoners had dreamed up such a service.
The Musk brothers brought Zip2 to life at 430 Sherman Avenue in Palo Alto. They rented a
studio-apartment-sized office—twenty feet by thirty feet—and acquired some basic furniture. The
three-story building had its quirks. There were no elevators, and the toilets often backed up. “It was
literally a shitty place to work,” said an early employee. To get a fast Internet connection, Musk struck
a deal with Ray Girouard, an entrepreneur who ran an Internet service provider operation from the
floor below the Zip2 offices. According to Girouard, Musk drilled a hole in the drywall near the Zip2
door and then strung an Ethernet cable down the stairwell to the ISP. “They were slow to pay a
couple of times but never stiffed me on the bill,” Girouard said.
Musk did all of the original coding behind the service himself, while the more amiable Kimbal
looked to ramp up the door-to-door sales operation. Musk had acquired a cheap license to a database
of business listings in the Bay Area that would give a business’s name and its address. He then
contacted Navteq, a company that had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to create digital maps and
directions that could be used in early GPS navigation-style devices, and struck a masterful bargain.
“We called them up, and they gave us the technology for free,” said Kimbal. Musk merged the two
databases together to get a rudimentary system up and running. Over time, Zip2’s engineers had to
augment this initial data haul with more maps to cover areas outside of major metropolitan areas and
to build custom turn-by-turn directions that would look good and work well on a home computer.
Errol Musk gave his sons $28,000 to help them through this period, but they were more or less
broke after getting the office space, licensing software, and buying some equipment. For the first three
months of Zip2’s life, Musk and his brother lived at the office. They had a small closet where they
kept their clothes and would shower at the YMCA. “Sometimes we ate four meals a day at Jack in the
Box,” Kimbal said. “It was open twenty-four hours, which suited our work schedule. I got a smoothie
one time, and there was something in it. I just pulled it out and kept drinking. I haven’t been able to
eat there since, but I can still recite their menu.”
Next, the brothers rented a two-bedroom apartment. They didn’t have the money or the inclination
to get furniture. So there were just a couple of mattresses on the floor. Musk somehow managed to
convince a young South Korean engineer to come work at Zip2 as an intern in exchange for room and
board. “This poor kid thought he was coming over for a job at a big company,” Kimbal said. “He
ended up living with us and had no idea what he was getting into.” One day, the intern drove the
Musks’ battered BMW 320i to work, and a wheel came off en route. The axle dug into the street at the
intersection of Page Mill Road and El Camino Real, and the groove it carved out remained visible for
years.
Zip2 may have been a go-go Internet enterprise aimed at the Information Age, but getting it off the
ground required old-fashioned door-to-door salesmanship. Businesses needed to be persuaded of the
Web’s benefits and charmed into paying for the unknown. In late 1995, the Musk brothers began
making their first hires and assembling a motley sales team. Jeff Heilman, a free-spirited twenty-yearold trying to figure out what to do with his life, arrived as one of Zip2’s first recruits. He’d been
watching TV late one night with his dad and seen a Web address printed at the bottom of the screen
during a commercial. “It was for something dot-com,” Heilman said. “I remember sitting there and
asking my Mercury News. “Internet Sales Apply Here!” it read, and Heilman got the gig. A handful of other
salespeople joined him and worked for commissions.
Musk never seemed to leave the office. He slept, not unlike a dog, on a beanbag next to his desk.
“Almost every day, I’d come in at seven thirty or eight A.M., and he’d be asleep right there on that
bag,” Heilman said. “Maybe he showered on the weekends. I don’t know.” Musk asked those first
employees of Zip2 to give him a kick when they arrived, and he’d wake up and get back to work.
While Musk did his possessed coder thing, Kimbal became the rah-rah sales leader. “Kimbal was the
eternal optimist, and he was very, very uplifting,” Heilman said. “I had never met anyone quite like
him.” Kimbal sent Heilman to the high-end Stanford shopping mall and to University Avenue, the main
drag in Palo Alto, to coax retailers into signing up with Zip2, explaining that a sponsored listing
would send a company to the top of search results. The big problem, of course, was that no one was
buying. Week after week, Heilman knocked on doors and returned to the office with very little to
report in the way of good news. The nicest responses came from the people who told Heilman that
advertising on the Internet sounded like the dumbest thing they had ever heard of. Most often, the shop
owners just told Heilman to leave and stop bothering them. When lunchtime came around, the Musks
would reach into a cigar box where they kept some cash, take Heilman out, and get the depressing
status reports on the sales.
Craig Mohr, another early employee, gave up his job selling real estate to hawk Zip2’s service.
He decided to court auto dealerships because they usually spent lots of money on advertising. He told
them about Zip2’s main website—www.totalinfo.com—and tried to convince them that demand was
high to get a listing like www.totalinfo.com/toyotaofsiliconvalley. The service did not always work
when Mohr demonstrated it or it would load very slowly, as was common back then. This forced him
to talk the customers into imagining Zip2’s potential. “One day I came back with about nine hundred
dollars in checks,” Mohr said. “I walked into the office and asked the guys what they wanted me to do
with the money. Elon stopped pounding his keyboard, leaned out from behind his monitor, and said,
‘No way, you’ve got money.’”
What kept the employees’ spirits up were the continuous improvements Musk made with the Zip2
software. The service had morphed from a proof-of-concept to an actual product that could be used
and demoed. Ever marketing savvy, the Musk brothers tried to make their Web service seem more
important by giving it an imposing physical body. Musk built a huge case around a standard PC and
lugged the unit onto a base with wheels. When prospective investors would come by, Musk would put
on a show and roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a minisupercomputer. “The investors thought that was impressive,” Kimbal said. Heilman also noticed that
the investors bought into Musk’s slavish devotion to the company. “Even then, as essentially a college
kid with zits, Elon had this drive that this thing—whatever it was—had to get done and that if he
didn’t do it, he’d miss his shot,” Heilman said. “I think that’s what the VCs saw—that he was willing
to stake his existence on building out this platform.” Musk actually said as much to one venture
capitalist, informing him, “My mentality is that of a samurai. I would rather commit seppuku than
fail.”
Early on in the Zip2 venture, Musk acquired an important confidant, who tempered some of these
more dramatic impulses. Greg Kouri, a Canadian businessman in his mid-thirties, had met the Musks
in Toronto and bought into the early Zip2 brainstorming. The boys had showed up at his door one
morning to inform Kouri that they intended to head to California to give the business a shot. Still in
his red bathrobe, Kouri went back into the house, dug around for a couple of minutes, and came back
with a wad of $6,000. In early 1996, he moved to California and joined Zip2 as a cofounder.
Kouri, who had done a number of real estate deals in the past and had actual business experience
and skills at reading people, served as the adult supervision at Zip2. The Canadian had a knack for
calming Musk and ended up becoming something of a mentor. “Really smart people sometimes don’t
understand that not everyone can keep up with them or go as fast,” said Derek Proudian, a venture
capitalist who would become Zip2’s chief executive officer. “Greg is one of the few people that Elon
would listen to and had a way of putting things in context for him.” Kouri also used to referee
fistfights between Elon and Kimbal, in the middle of the office.
“I don’t get in fights with anyone else, but Elon and I don’t have the ability to reconcile a vision
other than our own,” Kimbal said. During a particularly nasty scrap over a business decision, Elon
ripped some skin off his fist and had to go get a tetanus shot. Kouri put an end to the fights after that.
(Kouri died of a heart attack in 2012 at the age of fifty-one, having made a fortune investing in Musk’s
companies. Musk attended his funeral. “We owe him a lot,” said Kimbal.)
In early 1996, Zip2 underwent a massive change. The venture capital firm Mohr Davidow
Ventures had caught wind of a couple of South African boys trying to make a Yellow Pages for the
Internet and met with the brothers. Musk, while raw in his presentation skills, pitched the company
well enough, and the investors came away impressed with his energy. Mohr Davidow invested $3
million into the company.* With these funds in hand, the company officially changed its name from
Global Link to Zip2—the idea being zip to here, zip to there—moved to a larger office at 390
Cambridge Avenue in Palo Alto, and began hiring talented engineers. Zip2 also shifted its business
strategy. At the time, the company had built one of the best direction systems on the Web. Zip2 would
advance this technology and take it from focusing just on the Bay Area to having a national scope. The
company’s main focus, however, would be an altogether new play. Instead of selling its service doorto-door, Zip2 would create a software package that could be sold to newspapers, which would in turn
build their own directories for real estate, auto dealers, and classifieds. The newspapers were late
understanding how the Internet would impact their businesses, and Zip2’s software would give them a
quick way of getting online without needing to develop all their own technology from scratch. For its
part, Zip2 could chase bigger prey and get a cut of a nationwide network of listings.
This transition of the business model and the company’s makeup would be a seminal moment in
Musk’s life. The venture capitalists pushed Musk into the role of chief technology officer and hired
Rich Sorkin as the company’s CEO. Sorkin had worked at Creative Labs, a maker of audio
equipment, and run the business development group at the company, where he steered a number of
investments in Internet start-ups. Zip2’s investors saw him as experienced and clued in to the Web.
While Musk agreed to the arrangement, he came to resent giving up control of Zip2. “Probably the
biggest regret the whole time I worked with him was that he had made a deal with the devil with
Mohr Davidow,” said Jim Ambras, the vice president of engineering at Zip2. “Elon didn’t have any
operational responsibilities, and he wanted to be CEO.”
Ambras had worked at Hewlett-Packard Labs and Silicon Graphics Inc. and exemplified the highcaliber talent Zip2 brought on after the first wave of money arrived. Silicon Graphics, a maker of
high-end computers beloved by Hollywood, was the flashiest company of its day and had hoarded the
elite geeks of Silicon Valley. And yet Ambras used the promise of Internet riches to poach a team of
SGI’s smartest engineers over to Zip2. “Our attorneys got a letter from SGI saying that we were
cherry-picking the very best guys,” Ambras said. “Elon thought that was fantastic.”
While Musk had exceled as a self-taught coder, his skills weren’t nearly as polished as those of
the new hires. They took one look at Zip2’s code and began rewriting the vast majority of the
software. Musk bristled at some of their changes, but the computer scientists needed just a fraction of
the lines of code that Musk used to get their jobs done. They had a knack for dividing software
projects into chunks that could be altered and refined whereas Musk fell into the classic self-taught
coder trap of writing what developers call hairballs—big, monolithic hunks of code that could go
berserk for mysterious reasons. The engineers also brought a more refined working structure and
realistic deadlines to the engineering group. This was a welcome change from Musk’s approach,
which had been to set overly optimistic deadlines and then try to get engineers to work nonstop for
days on end to meet the goals. “If you asked Elon how long it would take to do something, there was
never anything in his mind that would take more than an hour,” Ambras said. “We came to interpret an
hour as really taking a day or two and if Elon ever did say something would take a day, we allowed
for a week or two weeks.”
Starting Zip2 and watching it grow imbued Musk with self-confidence. Terence Beney, one of
Musk’s high school friends, came to California for a visit and noticed the change in Musk’s character
right away. He watched Musk confront a nasty landlord who had been giving his mother, who was
renting an apartment in town, a hard time. “He said, ‘If you’re going to bully someone, bully me.’ It
was startling to see him take over the situation. The last time I had seen him he was this geeky,
awkward kid who would sometimes lose his temper. He was the kid you would pick on to get a
response. Now he was confident and in control.” Musk also began consciously trying to manage his
criticism of others. “Elon is not someone who would say, ‘I feel you. I see your point of view,’” said
Justine. “Because he doesn’t have that ‘I feel you’ dimension there were things that seemed obvious to
other people that weren’t that obvious to him. He had to learn that a twenty-something-year-old
shouldn’t really shoot down the plans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with
them. He learned to modify his behavior in certain ways. I just think he comes at the world through
strategy and intellect.” The personality tweaks worked with varying degrees of success. Musk still
tended to drive the young engineers mad with his work demands and blunt criticism. “I remember
being in a meeting once brainstorming about a new product—a new-car site,” said Doris Downes, the
creative director at Zip2. “Someone complained about a technical change that we wanted being
impossible. Elon turned and said, ‘I don’t really give a damn what you think,’ and walked out of the
meeting. For Elon, the word no does not exist, and he expects that attitude from everyone around
him.” Periodically, Musk let loose on the more senior executives as well. “You would see people
come out of the meetings with this disgusted look on their face,” Mohr, the salesman, said. “You don’t
get to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven and sure of himself.”
As Musk tried to come to terms with the changes the investors had inflicted on Zip2, he did enjoy
some of the perks of having big-money backing. The financiers helped the Musk brothers with their
visas. They also gave them $30,000 each to buy cars. Musk and Kimbal had traded in their
dilapidated BMW for a dilapidated sedan that they spray-painted with polka dots. Kimbal upgraded
from that to a BMW 3 Series, and Musk bought a Jaguar E-Type. “It kept breaking down, and would
arrive at the office on a flatbed,” Kimbal said. “But Elon always thought big.”*
As a bonding exercise one weekend, Musk, Ambras, a few other employees and friends took off
for a bike ride through the Saratoga Gap trail in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the riders had
been training and were accustomed to strenuous sessions and the summer’s heat. They set up the
mountains at a furious pace. After an hour, Russ Rive, Musk’s cousin, reached the top and proceeded
to vomit. Right behind him were the rest of the cyclists. Then, fifteen minutes later, Musk became
visible to the group. His face had turned purple, and sweat poured out of him, and he made it to the
top. “I always think back to that ride. He wasn’t close to being in the condition needed for it,”
Ambras said. “Anyone else would have quit or walked up their bike. As I watched him climb that
final hundred feet with suffering all over his face, I thought, That’s Elon. Do or die but don’t give up.”
Musk continued to be a ball of energy around the office as well. Ahead of visits by venture
capitalists and other investors, Musk would rally the troops and instruct them all to get on the phone
to create a buzzy atmosphere. He also formed a video-game team to participate in competitions
around Quake, a first-person-shooter game. “We competed in one of the first nationwide
tournaments,” Musk said. “We came in second, and we would have come in first, but one of our top
players’ machine crashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard. We won a few thousand
dollars.”
Zip2 had remarkable success courting newspapers. The New York Times, Knight Ridder, Hearst
Corporation, and other media properties signed up to its service. Some of these companies
contributed $50 million in additional funding for Zip2. Services like Craigslist with its free online
classifieds had just started to appear, and the newspapers needed some course of action. “The
newspapers knew they were in trouble with the Internet, and the idea was to sign up as many of them
as possible,” Ambras said. “They wanted classifieds and listings for real estate, automotive, and
entertainment and could use us as a platform for all these online services.” Zip2 acquired a trademark
for its “We Power the Press” slogan and the influx of cash kept Zip2 growing fast. Company
headquarters were soon so crowded that one desk ended up directly in front of the women’s
bathroom. In 1997, Zip2 moved into flashier, more spacious digs at 444 Castro Street in Mountain
View.
It irritated Musk that Zip2 had become a behind-the-scenes player to the newspapers. He believed
the company could offer interesting services directly to consumers and encouraged the purchase of the
domain name city.com with the hopes of turning it into a consumer destination. But the lure of the
media companies’ money kept Sorkin and the board on a conservative path, and they decided to worry
about a consumer push down the road.
In April 1998, Zip2 announced a blockbuster move to double down on its strategy. It would merge
with its main competitor CitySearch in a deal valued at around $300 million. The new company
would retain the CitySearch name, while Sorkin would head up the venture. On paper, the union
looked very much like a merger of equals. CitySearch had built up an extensive set of directories for
cities around the country. It also appeared to have strong sales and marketing teams that would
complement the talented engineers at Zip2. The merger had been announced in the press and seemed
inevitable.
The opinions on what happened next vary greatly. The logistics of the situation required the two
companies to go over each other’s books and to figure out which employees would be fired to avoid a
duplication of roles. This process raised some questions about how frank CitySearch had been with
its financials and rankled some executives at Zip2 who could see their positions being diminished or
erased altogether at the new company. One faction inside Zip2 argued that the deal should be
abandoned, while Sorkin demanded that it go through. Musk, who had been an early advocate of the
deal, turned against it. In May 1998, the two companies canceled the merger, and the press pounced,
making a big deal of the chaotic bust-up. Musk urged Zip2’s board to oust Sorkin and reinstate him as
CEO of Zip2. The board declined. Instead, Musk lost his chairman title, and Sorkin was replaced by
Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow. Sorkin considered Musk’s behavior
through the whole affair atrocious and later pointed to the board’s reaction and Musk’s demotion as
evidence that they felt the same way. “There was a lot of backlash and finger-pointing,” Proudian
said. “Elon wanted to be CEO, but I said, ‘This is your first company. Let’s find an acquirer and make
some money, so you can do your second, third, and fourth company.’”
With the deal busted, Zip2 found itself in a predicament. It was losing money. Musk still wanted
to go the consumer route, but Proudian feared that would take too much capital. Microsoft had
mounted a charge into the same market, and start-ups with mapping, real estate, and automotive ideas
multiplied. The Zip2 engineers were deflated and worried that they might not be able to outrun the
competition. Then, in February 1999, the PC maker Compaq Computer suddenly offered to pay $307
million in cash for Zip2. “It was like pennies from heaven,” said Ed Ho, a former Zip2 executive.
Zip2’s board accepted the offer, and the company rented out a restaurant in Palo Alto and threw a
huge party. Mohr Davidow had made back twenty times its original investment, and Musk and Kimbal
had come away with $22 million and $15 million, respectively. Musk never entertained the idea of
sticking around at Compaq. “As soon as it was clear the company would be sold, Elon was on to his
next project,” Proudian said. From that point on, Musk would fight to maintain control of his
companies and stay CEO. “We were overwhelmed and just thought these guys must know what they’re
doing,” Kimbal said. “But they’ didn’t. There was no vision once they took over. They were
investors, and we got on well with them, but the vision had just disappeared from the company.”
Years later, after he had time to reflect on the Zip2 situation, Musk realized that he could have
handled some of the situations with employees better. “I had never really run a team of any sort
before,” Musk said. “I’d never been a sports captain or a captain of anything or managed a single
person. I had to think, Okay, what are the things that affect how a team functions. The first obvious
assumption would be that other people will behave like you. But that’s not true. Even if they would
like to behave like you, they don’t necessarily have all the assumptions or information that you have
in your mind. So, if I know a certain set of things, and I talk to a replica of myself but only
communicate half the information, you can’t expect that the replica would come to the same
conclusion. You have to put yourself in a position where you say, ‘Well, how would this sound to
them, knowing what they know?’”
Employees at Zip2 would go home at night, come back, and find that Musk had changed their
work without talking to them, and Musk’s confrontational style did more harm than good. “Yeah, we
had some very good software engineers at Zip2, but I mean, I could code way better than them. And
I’d just go in and fix their fucking code,” Musk said. “I would be frustrated waiting for their stuff, so
I’m going to go and fix your code and now it runs five times faster, you idiot. There was one guy who
wrote a quantum mechanics equation, a quantum probability on the board, and he got it wrong. I’m
like, ‘How can you write that?’ Then I corrected it for him. He hated me after that. Eventually, I
realized, Okay, I might have fixed that thing but now I’ve made the person unproductive. It just wasn’t
a good way to go about things.”
Musk, the dot-com striver, had been both lucky and good. He had a decent idea, turned it into a
real service, and came out of the dot-com tumult with cash in his pockets, which was better than what
many of his compatriots could say. The process had been painful. Musk had yearned to be a leader,
but the people around him struggled to see how Musk as the CEO could work. As far as Musk was
concerned, they were all wrong, and he set out to prove his point with what would end up being even
more dramatic results.

PAYPAL MAFIA BOSS
THE SALE OF ZIP2 INFUSED ELON MUSK WITH A NEW BRAND OF CONFIDENCE. Much
like the video-game characters he adored, Musk had leveled up. He had solved Silicon Valley and
become what everyone at the time wanted to be—a dot-com millionaire. His next venture would need
to live up to his rapidly inflating ambition. This left Musk searching for an industry that had tons of
money and inefficiencies that he and the Internet could exploit. Musk began thinking back to his time
as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia. His big takeaway from that job, that bankers are rich and
dumb, now had the feel of a massive opportunity.
During his time working for the head of strategy at the bank in the early 1990s, Musk had been
asked to take a look at the company’s third-world debt portfolio. This pool of money went by the
depressing name of “less-developed country debt,” and Bank of Nova Scotia had billions of dollars
of it. Countries throughout South America and elsewhere had defaulted in the years prior, forcing the
bank to write down some of its debt value. Musk’s boss wanted him to dig into the bank’s holdings as
a learning experiment and try to determine how much the debt was actually worth.
While pursuing this project, Musk stumbled upon what seemed like an obvious business
opportunity. The United States had tried to help reduce the debt burden of a number of developing
countries through so-called Brady bonds, in which the U.S. government basically backstopped the
debt of countries like Brazil and Argentina. Musk noticed an arbitrage play. “I calculated the backstop
value, and it was something like fifty cents on the dollar, while the actual debt was trading at twentyfive cents,” Musk said. “This was like the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize it.”
Musk tried to remain cool and calm as he rang Goldman Sachs, one of the main traders in this market,
and probed around about what he had seen. He inquired as to how much Brazilian debt might be
available at the 25-cents price. “The guy said, ‘How much do you want?’ and I came up with some
ridiculous number like ten billion dollars,” Musk said. When the trader confirmed that was doable,
Musk hung up the phone. “I was thinking that they had to be fucking crazy because you could double
your money. Everything was backed by Uncle Sam. It was a no-brainer.”
Musk had spent the summer earning about fourteen dollars an hour and getting chewed out for
using the executive coffee machine, among other status infractions, and figured his moment to shine
and make a big bonus had arrived. He sprinted up to his boss’s office and pitched the opportunity of a
lifetime. “You can make billions of dollars for free,” he said. His boss told Musk to write up a report,
which soon got passed up to the bank’s CEO, who promptly rejected the proposal, saying the bank
had been burned on Brazilian and Argentinian debt before and didn’t want to mess with it again. “I
tried to tell them that’s not the point,” Musk said. “The point is that it’s fucking backed by Uncle Sam.
It doesn’t matter what the South Americans do. You cannot lose unless you think the U.S. Treasury is
going to default. But they still didn’t do it, and I was stunned. Later in life, as I competed against the
banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave me confidence. All the bankers did was copy
what everyone else did. If everyone else ran off a bloody cliff, they’d run right off a cliff with them. If
there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was picking it up, they
wouldn’t pick it up, either.”
In the years that followed, Musk considered starting an Internet bank and discussed it openly
during his internship at Pinnacle Research in 1995. The youthful Musk lectured the scientists about the
inevitable transition coming in finance toward online systems, but they tried to talk him down, saying
that it would takes ages for Web security to be good enough to win over consumers. Musk, though,
remained convinced that the finance industry could do with a major upgrade and that he could have a
big influence on banking with a relatively small investment. “Money is low bandwidth,” he said,
during a speech at Stanford University in 2003, to describe his thinking. “You don’t need some sort of
big infrastructure improvement to do things with it. It’s really just an entry in a database.”
The actual plan that Musk concocted was beyond grandiose. As the researchers at Pinnacle had
pointed out, people were barely comfortable buying books online. They might take their chances
entering a credit card number but exposing just their bank accounts to the Web was out of the question
to many. Pah. So what? Musk wanted to build a full-service financial institution online: a company
that would have savings and checking accounts as well as brokerage services and insurance. The
technology to build such a service was possible, but navigating the regulatory hell of creating an
online bank from scratch looked like an intractable problem to optimists and an impossibility to more
level heads. This was not dishing out directions to a pizzeria or putting up a house listing. It was
dealing with people’s finances, and there would be real repercussions if the service did not work as
billed.
Undaunted, Musk kicked this new plan into action before Zip2 had even been sold. He chatted up
some of the best engineers at the company to get a feel for who might be willing to join him in another
venture. Musk also bounced his ideas off some contacts he’d made at the bank in Canada. In January
1999, with Zip2’s board seeking a buyer, Musk began to formalize his banking plan. The deal with
Compaq was announced the next month. And in March, Musk incorporated X.com, a finance start-up
with a pornographic-sounding name.
It had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian backpacker to becoming a
multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With his $22 million, he moved from sharing an
apartment with three roommates to buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also
bought a $1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly. Musk embraced
the newfound celebrity that he’d earned as part of the dot-com millionaire set. He let CNN show up at
his apartment at 7 A.M. to film the delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of
Musk’s place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street, while Musk stood slackjawed with his arms folded. “There are sixty-two McLarens in the world, and I will own one of
them,” he told CNN. “Wow, I can’t believe it’s actually here. That’s pretty wild, man.”
CNN interspersed video of the car delivery with interviews with Musk. The whole time he
looked like a caricature of an engineer who had made it big. Musk’s hair had started thinning, and he
had a closely cropped cut that accentuated his boyish face. He wore an all-too-big brown sport coat
and checked his cell phone from his lavish car, sitting next to his gorgeous girlfriend, Justine, and he
seemed spellbound by his life. Musk rolled out one laughable rich-guy line after another, talking first
about the Zip2 deal—“Receiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a large number of Ben
Franklins”—next about the awesomeness of his life—“There it is, gentlemen, the fastest car in the
world”—and then about his prodigious ambition—“I could go and buy one of the islands in the
Bahamas and turn it into my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build and
create a new company.” The camera crew followed Musk to the X.com offices, where his cocksure
delivery led to another round of cringe-worthy statements: “I do not fit the picture of a banker,”
“Raising fifty million dollars is a matter of making a series of phone calls, and the money is there,” “I
think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.”
Musk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car away from Ralph Lauren,
who had also inquired about buying it. Even very wealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve
something like a McLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He drove it
all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com offices. His friends were horrified
to see such a work of art covered with bird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway. One day,
Musk e-mailed fellow McLaren owner Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of the software maker
Oracle, out of the blue to see if he wanted to go race cars around a track for fun. Jim Clark, another
billionaire who liked fast things, caught wind of the proposal and told a friend that he needed to rush
over to the local Ferrari dealership to buy something that could compete. Musk had joined the big
boys’ club. “Elon was super-excited about all of this,” said George Zachary, a venture capitalist and
close friend of Musk’s. “He showed me the correspondence with Larry.” The next year, while driving
down Sand Hill Road to meet with an investor, Musk turned to a friend in the car and said, “Watch
this.” He floored the car, did a lane change, spun out, and hit an embankment, which started the car
spinning in midair like a Frisbee. The windows and wheels were blown to smithereens, and the body
of the car damaged. Musk again turned to his companion and said, “The funny part is it wasn’t
insured.” The two of them then thumbed a ride to the venture capitalist’s office.
To his credit, Musk did not fully buy in to this playboy persona. He actually plowed the majority
of the money he made from Zip2 into X.com. There were practical reasons for this decision. Investors
catch a break under the tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of months.
But even by Silicon Valley’s high-risk standards, it was shocking to put so much of one’s newfound
wealth into something as iffy as an online bank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into
X.com, leaving him, after taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. “That’s part of what separates
Elon from mere mortals,” said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive, who went on to cofound X.com.
“He’s willing to take an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays
off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.”
Musk’s decision to invest so much money in X.com looks even more unusual in hindsight. Much of
the point of being a dot-com success in 1999 was to prove yourself once, stash away your millions,
and then use your credentials to talk other people into betting their money on your next venture. Musk
would certainly go on to rely on outside investors, but he put major skin in the game as well. So while
Musk could be found on television talking like the rest of the self-absorbed dot-com schmucks, he
behaved more like a throwback to Silicon Valley’s earlier days, when the founders of companies like
Intel were willing to take huge gambles on themselves.
Where Zip2 had been a neat, useful idea, X.com held the promise of fomenting a major revolution.
Musk, for the first time, would be confronting a deep-pocketed, entrenched industry head-on with the
hopes of upending all of the incumbents. Musk also began to hone his trademark style of entering an
ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he knew very little about the industry’s nuances
bother him in the slightest. He had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he
could run the business better than everyone else. Musk’s ego and confidence had started heading
toward the levels that would inspire some and leave others thinking of him as pompous and
unscrupulous. The creation of X.com would ultimately reveal a great deal about Musk’s creativity,
relentless drive, confrontational style, and foibles as a leader. Musk would also get another taste of
being pushed aside at his own company and the pain that accompanies a grand vision left unfulfilled.
Musk assembled what looked like an all-star crew to start X.com. Ho had worked at SGI and
Zip2 as an engineer, and his peers marveled at his coding and team-management skills. They were
joined by a pair of Canadians with finance experience—Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne. Musk
had met Fricker during his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the two really hit it off. A
Rhodes scholar, Fricker brought the knowledge of the banking world’s mechanics that X.com would
need. Payne was Fricker’s friend from the Canadian finance community. All four men were
considered cofounders of the company, while Musk emerged as the largest shareholder thanks to his
hefty up-front investment. X.com began, like so many Silicon Valley operations, at a house where the
over as CEO

In the next video, I introduce Flask & Socket.io to establish bi-directional client-server communication. Ultimately, this will be done to connect our model to the simulation.

That being said, the content in the next two videos is very technical, and not very relevant to deep learning. I would still highly recommend following along the two videos so that you don't get lost.

Otherwise, if you choose to skip the two videos, then that's fine. You'll have to simply copy the code below into an atom project, drag your model into the same project, make the appropriate installations and run the code to establish the connection. Then run your simulation.
