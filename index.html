ELON’S FIRST START-UP
IN THE SUMMER OF 1994, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, took their first steps toward becoming
honest-to-God Americans. They set off on a road trip across the country.
Kimbal had been working as a franchisee for College Pro Painters and done well for himself,
running what amounted to a small business. He sold off his part of the franchise and pooled the money
with what Musk had on hand to buy a beat-up 1970s BMW 320i. The brothers began their trip near
San Francisco in August, as temperatures in California soared. The first part of the drive took them
down to Needles, a city in the Mojave Desert. There they experienced the sweaty thrill of 120-degree
weather in a car with no air-conditioning and learned to love pit stops at Carl’s Jr. burger joints,
where they spent hours recuperating in the cold.
The trip provided plenty of time for your typical twenty-something hijinks and raging capitalist
daydreaming. The Web had just started to become accessible to the public thanks to the rise of
directory sites like Yahoo! and tools like Netscape’s browser. The brothers were tuned in to the
Internet and thought they might like to start a company together doing something on the Web. From
California to Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Illinois, they took turns driving, brainstorming,
and talking shit before heading back east to get Musk to school that fall. The best idea to arise from
the journey was an online network for doctors. This wasn’t meant to be something as ambitious as
electronic health records but more of a system for physicians to exchange information and
collaborate. “It seemed like the medical industry was one that could be disrupted,” Kimbal said. “I
went to work on a business plan and the sales and marketing side of it later, but it didn’t fly. We didn’t
love it.”
Musk had spent the earlier part of that summer in Silicon Valley, holding down a pair of
internships. By day, he worked at Pinnacle Research Institute. Based in Los Gatos, Pinnacle was a
much-ballyhooed start-up with a team of scientists exploring ways in which ultracapacitors could be
used as a revolutionary fuel source in electric and hybrid vehicles. The work also veered—at least
conceptually—into more bizarre territory. Musk could talk at length about how ultracapacitors might
be used to build laser-based sidearms in the tradition of Star Wars and just about any other futuristic
film. The laser guns would release rounds of enormous energy, and then the shooter would replace an
ultracapacitor at the base of the gun, much like swapping out a clip of bullets, and start blasting away
again. Ultracapacitors also looked promising as the power supplies for missiles. They were more
resilient than batteries under the mechanical stresses of a launch and would hold a more consistent
charge over long periods of time. Musk fell in love with the work at Pinnacle and began using it as
the basis for some of his business plan experiments at Penn and for his industrialist fantasies.
In the evenings, Musk headed to Rocket Science Games, a start-up based in Palo Alto that wanted
to create the most advanced video games ever made by moving them off cartridges and onto CDs that
could hold more information. The CDs would in theory allow them to bring Hollywood-style
storytelling and production quality to the games. A team of budding all-stars who were a mix of
engineers and film people was assembled to pull off the work. Tony Fadell, who would later drivemuch of the development of both the iPod and iPhone at Apple, worked at Rocket Science, as did the
guys who developed the QuickTime multimedia software for Apple. They also had people who
worked on the original Star Wars effects at Industrial Light & Magic and some who did games at
LucasArts Entertainment. Rocket Science gave Musk a flavor for what Silicon Valley had to offer
both from a talent and culture perspective. There were people working at the office twenty-four hours
a day, and they didn’t think it at all odd that Musk would turn up around 5 P.M. every evening to start
his second job. “We brought him in to write some very menial low-level code,” said Peter Barrett, an
Australian engineer who helped start the company. “He was completely unflappable. After a short
while, I don’t think anyone was giving him any direction, and he ended up making what he wanted to
make.”
Specifically, Musk had been asked to write the drivers that would let joysticks and mice
communicate with various computers and games. Drivers are the same types of annoying files that you
have to install to get a printer or camera working with a home computer—true grunt work. A selftaught programmer, Musk fancied himself quite good at coding and assigned himself to more
ambitious jobs. “I was basically trying to figure out how you could multitask stuff, so you could read
video from a CD, while running a game at the same time,” Musk said. “At the time, you could do one
or the other. It was this complicated bit of assembly programming.” Complicated indeed. Musk had to
issue commands that spoke directly to a computer’s main microprocessor and fiddled with the most
basic functions that made the machine work. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple’s
QuickTime, had overseen the hiring of Musk and marveled at his ability to pull all-nighters. “He had
boundless energy,” Leak said. “Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but
he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”
Musk found in Silicon Valley a wealth of the opportunity he’d been seeking and a place equal to
his ambitions. He would return two summers in a row and then bolt west permanently after graduating
with dual degrees from Penn. He initially intended to pursue a doctorate in materials science and
physics at Stanford and to advance the work he’d done at Pinnacle on ultracapacitors. As the story
goes, Musk dropped out of Stanford after two days, finding the Internet’s call irresistible. He talked
Kimbal into moving to Silicon Valley as well, so they could conquer the Web together.
The first inklings of a viable Internet business had come to Musk during his internships. A
salesperson from the Yellow Pages had come into one of the start-up offices. He tried to sell the idea
of an online listing to complement the regular listing a company would have in the big, fat Yellow
Pages book. The salesman struggled with his pitch and clearly had little grasp of what the Internet
actually was or how someone would find a business on it. The flimsy pitch got Musk thinking, and he
reached out to Kimbal, talking up the idea of helping businesses get online for the first time.
“Elon said, ‘These guys don’t know what they are talking about. Maybe this is something we can
do,’” Kimbal said. This was 1995, and the brothers were about to form Global Link Information
Network, a start-up that would eventually be renamed Zip2. (For details on the controversy
surrounding Zip2’s founding and Musk’s academic record, see Appendix 1.)
The Zip2 idea was ingenious. Few small businesses in 1995 understood the ramifications of the
Internet. They had little idea how to get on it and didn’t really see the value in creating a website for
their business or even in having a Yellow Pages–like listing online. Musk and his brother hoped to
convince restaurants, clothing shops, hairdressers, and the like that the time had come for them to
make their presence known to the Web-surfing public. Zip2 would create a searchable directory ofbusinesses and tie this into maps. Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that
everyone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza parlor and the turn-by-turn
directions to get there. This may seem obvious today—think Yelp meets Google Maps—but back
then, not even stoners had dreamed up such a service.
The Musk brothers brought Zip2 to life at 430 Sherman Avenue in Palo Alto. They rented a
studio-apartment-sized office—twenty feet by thirty feet—and acquired some basic furniture. The
three-story building had its quirks. There were no elevators, and the toilets often backed up. “It was
literally a shitty place to work,” said an early employee. To get a fast Internet connection, Musk struck
a deal with Ray Girouard, an entrepreneur who ran an Internet service provider operation from the
floor below the Zip2 offices. According to Girouard, Musk drilled a hole in the drywall near the Zip2
door and then strung an Ethernet cable down the stairwell to the ISP. “They were slow to pay a
couple of times but never stiffed me on the bill,” Girouard said.
Musk did all of the original coding behind the service himself, while the more amiable Kimbal
looked to ramp up the door-to-door sales operation. Musk had acquired a cheap license to a database
of business listings in the Bay Area that would give a business’s name and its address. He then
contacted Navteq, a company that had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to create digital maps and
directions that could be used in early GPS navigation-style devices, and struck a masterful bargain.
“We called them up, and they gave us the technology for free,” said Kimbal. Musk merged the two
databases together to get a rudimentary system up and running. Over time, Zip2’s engineers had to
augment this initial data haul with more maps to cover areas outside of major metropolitan areas and
to build custom turn-by-turn directions that would look good and work well on a home computer.
Errol Musk gave his sons $28,000 to help them through this period, but they were more or less
broke after getting the office space, licensing software, and buying some equipment. For the first three
months of Zip2’s life, Musk and his brother lived at the office. They had a small closet where they
kept their clothes and would shower at the YMCA. “Sometimes we ate four meals a day at Jack in the
Box,” Kimbal said. “It was open twenty-four hours, which suited our work schedule. I got a smoothie
one time, and there was something in it. I just pulled it out and kept drinking. I haven’t been able to
eat there since, but I can still recite their menu.”
Next, the brothers rented a two-bedroom apartment. They didn’t have the money or the inclination
to get furniture. So there were just a couple of mattresses on the floor. Musk somehow managed to
convince a young South Korean engineer to come work at Zip2 as an intern in exchange for room and
board. “This poor kid thought he was coming over for a job at a big company,” Kimbal said. “He
ended up living with us and had no idea what he was getting into.” One day, the intern drove the
Musks’ battered BMW 320i to work, and a wheel came off en route. The axle dug into the street at the
intersection of Page Mill Road and El Camino Real, and the groove it carved out remained visible for
years.
Zip2 may have been a go-go Internet enterprise aimed at the Information Age, but getting it off the
ground required old-fashioned door-to-door salesmanship. Businesses needed to be persuaded of the
Web’s benefits and charmed into paying for the unknown. In late 1995, the Musk brothers began
making their first hires and assembling a motley sales team. Jeff Heilman, a free-spirited twenty-yearold trying to figure out what to do with his life, arrived as one of Zip2’s first recruits. He’d been
watching TV late one night with his dad and seen a Web address printed at the bottom of the screen
during a commercial. “It was for something dot-com,” Heilman said. “I remember sitting there andasking my dad what we were looking at. He said he didn’t know, either. That’s when I realized I had
to go find me some Internet.” Heilman spent a couple of weeks trying to chat up people who could
explain the Internet to him and then stumbled on a two-by-two-inch Zip2 job listing in the San Jose
Mercury News. “Internet Sales Apply Here!” it read, and Heilman got the gig. A handful of other
salespeople joined him and worked for commissions.
Musk never seemed to leave the office. He slept, not unlike a dog, on a beanbag next to his desk.
“Almost every day, I’d come in at seven thirty or eight A.M., and he’d be asleep right there on that
bag,” Heilman said. “Maybe he showered on the weekends. I don’t know.” Musk asked those first
employees of Zip2 to give him a kick when they arrived, and he’d wake up and get back to work.
While Musk did his possessed coder thing, Kimbal became the rah-rah sales leader. “Kimbal was the
eternal optimist, and he was very, very uplifting,” Heilman said. “I had never met anyone quite like
him.” Kimbal sent Heilman to the high-end Stanford shopping mall and to University Avenue, the main
drag in Palo Alto, to coax retailers into signing up with Zip2, explaining that a sponsored listing
would send a company to the top of search results. The big problem, of course, was that no one was
buying. Week after week, Heilman knocked on doors and returned to the office with very little to
report in the way of good news. The nicest responses came from the people who told Heilman that
advertising on the Internet sounded like the dumbest thing they had ever heard of. Most often, the shop
owners just told Heilman to leave and stop bothering them. When lunchtime came around, the Musks
would reach into a cigar box where they kept some cash, take Heilman out, and get the depressing
status reports on the sales.
Craig Mohr, another early employee, gave up his job selling real estate to hawk Zip2’s service.
He decided to court auto dealerships because they usually spent lots of money on advertising. He told
them about Zip2’s main website—www.totalinfo.com—and tried to convince them that demand was
high to get a listing like www.totalinfo.com/toyotaofsiliconvalley. The service did not always work
when Mohr demonstrated it or it would load very slowly, as was common back then. This forced him
to talk the customers into imagining Zip2’s potential. “One day I came back with about nine hundred
dollars in checks,” Mohr said. “I walked into the office and asked the guys what they wanted me to do
with the money. Elon stopped pounding his keyboard, leaned out from behind his monitor, and said,
‘No way, you’ve got money.’”
What kept the employees’ spirits up were the continuous improvements Musk made with the Zip2
software. The service had morphed from a proof-of-concept to an actual product that could be used
and demoed. Ever marketing savvy, the Musk brothers tried to make their Web service seem more
important by giving it an imposing physical body. Musk built a huge case around a standard PC and
lugged the unit onto a base with wheels. When prospective investors would come by, Musk would put
on a show and roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a minisupercomputer. “The investors thought that was impressive,” Kimbal said. Heilman also noticed that
the investors bought into Musk’s slavish devotion to the company. “Even then, as essentially a college
kid with zits, Elon had this drive that this thing—whatever it was—had to get done and that if he
didn’t do it, he’d miss his shot,” Heilman said. “I think that’s what the VCs saw—that he was willing
to stake his existence on building out this platform.” Musk actually said as much to one venture
capitalist, informing him, “My mentality is that of a samurai. I would rather commit seppuku than
fail.”
Early on in the Zip2 venture, Musk acquired an important confidant, who tempered some of thesemore dramatic impulses. Greg Kouri, a Canadian businessman in his mid-thirties, had met the Musks
in Toronto and bought into the early Zip2 brainstorming. The boys had showed up at his door one
morning to inform Kouri that they intended to head to California to give the business a shot. Still in
his red bathrobe, Kouri went back into the house, dug around for a couple of minutes, and came back
with a wad of $6,000. In early 1996, he moved to California and joined Zip2 as a cofounder.
Kouri, who had done a number of real estate deals in the past and had actual business experience
and skills at reading people, served as the adult supervision at Zip2. The Canadian had a knack for
calming Musk and ended up becoming something of a mentor. “Really smart people sometimes don’t
understand that not everyone can keep up with them or go as fast,” said Derek Proudian, a venture
capitalist who would become Zip2’s chief executive officer. “Greg is one of the few people that Elon
would listen to and had a way of putting things in context for him.” Kouri also used to referee
fistfights between Elon and Kimbal, in the middle of the office.
“I don’t get in fights with anyone else, but Elon and I don’t have the ability to reconcile a vision
other than our own,” Kimbal said. During a particularly nasty scrap over a business decision, Elon
ripped some skin off his fist and had to go get a tetanus shot. Kouri put an end to the fights after that.
(Kouri died of a heart attack in 2012 at the age of fifty-one, having made a fortune investing in Musk’s
companies. Musk attended his funeral. “We owe him a lot,” said Kimbal.)
In early 1996, Zip2 underwent a massive change. The venture capital firm Mohr Davidow
Ventures had caught wind of a couple of South African boys trying to make a Yellow Pages for the
Internet and met with the brothers. Musk, while raw in his presentation skills, pitched the company
well enough, and the investors came away impressed with his energy. Mohr Davidow invested $3
million into the company.* With these funds in hand, the company officially changed its name from
Global Link to Zip2—the idea being zip to here, zip to there—moved to a larger office at 390
Cambridge Avenue in Palo Alto, and began hiring talented engineers. Zip2 also shifted its business
strategy. At the time, the company had built one of the best direction systems on the Web. Zip2 would
advance this technology and take it from focusing just on the Bay Area to having a national scope. The
company’s main focus, however, would be an altogether new play. Instead of selling its service doorto-door, Zip2 would create a software package that could be sold to newspapers, which would in turn
build their own directories for real estate, auto dealers, and classifieds. The newspapers were late
understanding how the Internet would impact their businesses, and Zip2’s software would give them a
quick way of getting online without needing to develop all their own technology from scratch. For its
part, Zip2 could chase bigger prey and get a cut of a nationwide network of listings.
This transition of the business model and the company’s makeup would be a seminal moment in
Musk’s life. The venture capitalists pushed Musk into the role of chief technology officer and hired
Rich Sorkin as the company’s CEO. Sorkin had worked at Creative Labs, a maker of audio
equipment, and run the business development group at the company, where he steered a number of
investments in Internet start-ups. Zip2’s investors saw him as experienced and clued in to the Web.
While Musk agreed to the arrangement, he came to resent giving up control of Zip2. “Probably the
biggest regret the whole time I worked with him was that he had made a deal with the devil with
Mohr Davidow,” said Jim Ambras, the vice president of engineering at Zip2. “Elon didn’t have any
operational responsibilities, and he wanted to be CEO.”
Ambras had worked at Hewlett-Packard Labs and Silicon Graphics Inc. and exemplified the highcaliber talent Zip2 brought on after the first wave of money arrived. Silicon Graphics, a maker ofhigh-end computers beloved by Hollywood, was the flashiest company of its day and had hoarded the
elite geeks of Silicon Valley. And yet Ambras used the promise of Internet riches to poach a team of
SGI’s smartest engineers over to Zip2. “Our attorneys got a letter from SGI saying that we were
cherry-picking the very best guys,” Ambras said. “Elon thought that was fantastic.”
While Musk had exceled as a self-taught coder, his skills weren’t nearly as polished as those of
the new hires. They took one look at Zip2’s code and began rewriting the vast majority of the
software. Musk bristled at some of their changes, but the computer scientists needed just a fraction of
the lines of code that Musk used to get their jobs done. They had a knack for dividing software
projects into chunks that could be altered and refined whereas Musk fell into the classic self-taught
coder trap of writing what developers call hairballs—big, monolithic hunks of code that could go
berserk for mysterious reasons. The engineers also brought a more refined working structure and
realistic deadlines to the engineering group. This was a welcome change from Musk’s approach,
which had been to set overly optimistic deadlines and then try to get engineers to work nonstop for
days on end to meet the goals. “If you asked Elon how long it would take to do something, there was
never anything in his mind that would take more than an hour,” Ambras said. “We came to interpret an
hour as really taking a day or two and if Elon ever did say something would take a day, we allowed
for a week or two weeks.”
Starting Zip2 and watching it grow imbued Musk with self-confidence. Terence Beney, one of
Musk’s high school friends, came to California for a visit and noticed the change in Musk’s character
right away. He watched Musk confront a nasty landlord who had been giving his mother, who was
renting an apartment in town, a hard time. “He said, ‘If you’re going to bully someone, bully me.’ It
was startling to see him take over the situation. The last time I had seen him he was this geeky,
awkward kid who would sometimes lose his temper. He was the kid you would pick on to get a
response. Now he was confident and in control.” Musk also began consciously trying to manage his
criticism of others. “Elon is not someone who would say, ‘I feel you. I see your point of view,’” said
Justine. “Because he doesn’t have that ‘I feel you’ dimension there were things that seemed obvious to
other people that weren’t that obvious to him. He had to learn that a twenty-something-year-old
shouldn’t really shoot down the plans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with
them. He learned to modify his behavior in certain ways. I just think he comes at the world through
strategy and intellect.” The personality tweaks worked with varying degrees of success. Musk still
tended to drive the young engineers mad with his work demands and blunt criticism. “I remember
being in a meeting once brainstorming about a new product—a new-car site,” said Doris Downes, the
creative director at Zip2. “Someone complained about a technical change that we wanted being
impossible. Elon turned and said, ‘I don’t really give a damn what you think,’ and walked out of the
meeting. For Elon, the word no does not exist, and he expects that attitude from everyone around
him.” Periodically, Musk let loose on the more senior executives as well. “You would see people
come out of the meetings with this disgusted look on their face,” Mohr, the salesman, said. “You don’t
get to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven and sure of himself.”
As Musk tried to come to terms with the changes the investors had inflicted on Zip2, he did enjoy
some of the perks of having big-money backing. The financiers helped the Musk brothers with their
visas. They also gave them $30,000 each to buy cars. Musk and Kimbal had traded in their
dilapidated BMW for a dilapidated sedan that they spray-painted with polka dots. Kimbal upgraded
from that to a BMW 3 Series, and Musk bought a Jaguar E-Type. “It kept breaking down, and wouldarrive at the office on a flatbed,” Kimbal said. “But Elon always thought big.”*
As a bonding exercise one weekend, Musk, Ambras, a few other employees and friends took off
for a bike ride through the Saratoga Gap trail in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the riders had
been training and were accustomed to strenuous sessions and the summer’s heat. They set up the
mountains at a furious pace. After an hour, Russ Rive, Musk’s cousin, reached the top and proceeded
to vomit. Right behind him were the rest of the cyclists. Then, fifteen minutes later, Musk became
visible to the group. His face had turned purple, and sweat poured out of him, and he made it to the
top. “I always think back to that ride. He wasn’t close to being in the condition needed for it,”
Ambras said. “Anyone else would have quit or walked up their bike. As I watched him climb that
final hundred feet with suffering all over his face, I thought, That’s Elon. Do or die but don’t give up.”
Musk continued to be a ball of energy around the office as well. Ahead of visits by venture
capitalists and other investors, Musk would rally the troops and instruct them all to get on the phone
to create a buzzy atmosphere. He also formed a video-game team to participate in competitions
around Quake, a first-person-shooter game. “We competed in one of the first nationwide
tournaments,” Musk said. “We came in second, and we would have come in first, but one of our top
players’ machine crashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard. We won a few thousand
dollars.”
Zip2 had remarkable success courting newspapers. The New York Times, Knight Ridder, Hearst
Corporation, and other media properties signed up to its service. Some of these companies
contributed $50 million in additional funding for Zip2. Services like Craigslist with its free online
classifieds had just started to appear, and the newspapers needed some course of action. “The
newspapers knew they were in trouble with the Internet, and the idea was to sign up as many of them
as possible,” Ambras said. “They wanted classifieds and listings for real estate, automotive, and
entertainment and could use us as a platform for all these online services.” Zip2 acquired a trademark
for its “We Power the Press” slogan and the influx of cash kept Zip2 growing fast. Company
headquarters were soon so crowded that one desk ended up directly in front of the women’s
bathroom. In 1997, Zip2 moved into flashier, more spacious digs at 444 Castro Street in Mountain
View.
It irritated Musk that Zip2 had become a behind-the-scenes player to the newspapers. He believed
the company could offer interesting services directly to consumers and encouraged the purchase of the
domain name city.com with the hopes of turning it into a consumer destination. But the lure of the
media companies’ money kept Sorkin and the board on a conservative path, and they decided to worry
about a consumer push down the road.
In April 1998, Zip2 announced a blockbuster move to double down on its strategy. It would merge
with its main competitor CitySearch in a deal valued at around $300 million. The new company
would retain the CitySearch name, while Sorkin would head up the venture. On paper, the union
looked very much like a merger of equals. CitySearch had built up an extensive set of directories for
cities around the country. It also appeared to have strong sales and marketing teams that would
complement the talented engineers at Zip2. The merger had been announced in the press and seemed
inevitable.
The opinions on what happened next vary greatly. The logistics of the situation required the two
companies to go over each other’s books and to figure out which employees would be fired to avoid a
duplication of roles. This process raised some questions about how frank CitySearch had been withits financials and rankled some executives at Zip2 who could see their positions being diminished or
erased altogether at the new company. One faction inside Zip2 argued that the deal should be
abandoned, while Sorkin demanded that it go through. Musk, who had been an early advocate of the
deal, turned against it. In May 1998, the two companies canceled the merger, and the press pounced,
making a big deal of the chaotic bust-up. Musk urged Zip2’s board to oust Sorkin and reinstate him as
CEO of Zip2. The board declined. Instead, Musk lost his chairman title, and Sorkin was replaced by
Derek Proudian, a venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow. Sorkin considered Musk’s behavior
through the whole affair atrocious and later pointed to the board’s reaction and Musk’s demotion as
evidence that they felt the same way. “There was a lot of backlash and finger-pointing,” Proudian
said. “Elon wanted to be CEO, but I said, ‘This is your first company. Let’s find an acquirer and make
some money, so you can do your second, third, and fourth company.’”
With the deal busted, Zip2 found itself in a predicament. It was losing money. Musk still wanted
to go the consumer route, but Proudian feared that would take too much capital. Microsoft had
mounted a charge into the same market, and start-ups with mapping, real estate, and automotive ideas
multiplied. The Zip2 engineers were deflated and worried that they might not be able to outrun the
competition. Then, in February 1999, the PC maker Compaq Computer suddenly offered to pay $307
million in cash for Zip2. “It was like pennies from heaven,” said Ed Ho, a former Zip2 executive.
Zip2’s board accepted the offer, and the company rented out a restaurant in Palo Alto and threw a
huge party. Mohr Davidow had made back twenty times its original investment, and Musk and Kimbal
had come away with $22 million and $15 million, respectively. Musk never entertained the idea of
sticking around at Compaq. “As soon as it was clear the company would be sold, Elon was on to his
next project,” Proudian said. From that point on, Musk would fight to maintain control of his
companies and stay CEO. “We were overwhelmed and just thought these guys must know what they’re
doing,” Kimbal said. “But they’ didn’t. There was no vision once they took over. They were
investors, and we got on well with them, but the vision had just disappeared from the company.”
Years later, after he had time to reflect on the Zip2 situation, Musk realized that he could have
handled some of the situations with employees better. “I had never really run a team of any sort
before,” Musk said. “I’d never been a sports captain or a captain of anything or managed a single
person. I had to think, Okay, what are the things that affect how a team functions. The first obvious
assumption would be that other people will behave like you. But that’s not true. Even if they would
like to behave like you, they don’t necessarily have all the assumptions or information that you have
in your mind. So, if I know a certain set of things, and I talk to a replica of myself but only
communicate half the information, you can’t expect that the replica would come to the same
conclusion. You have to put yourself in a position where you say, ‘Well, how would this sound to
them, knowing what they know?’”
Employees at Zip2 would go home at night, come back, and find that Musk had changed their
work without talking to them, and Musk’s confrontational style did more harm than good. “Yeah, we
had some very good software engineers at Zip2, but I mean, I could code way better than them. And
I’d just go in and fix their fucking code,” Musk said. “I would be frustrated waiting for their stuff, so
I’m going to go and fix your code and now it runs five times faster, you idiot. There was one guy who
wrote a quantum mechanics equation, a quantum probability on the board, and he got it wrong. I’m
like, ‘How can you write that?’ Then I corrected it for him. He hated me after that. Eventually, I
realized, Okay, I might have fixed that thing but now I’ve made the person unproductive. It just wasn’ta good way to go about things.”
Musk, the dot-com striver, had been both lucky and good. He had a decent idea, turned it into a
real service, and came out of the dot-com tumult with cash in his pockets, which was better than what
many of his compatriots could say. The process had been painful. Musk had yearned to be a leader,
but the people around him struggled to see how Musk as the CEO could work. As far as Musk was
concerned, they were all wrong, and he set out to prove his point with what would end up being even
more dramatic results.5PAYPAL MAFIA BOSS
THE SALE OF ZIP2 INFUSED ELON MUSK WITH A NEW BRAND OF CONFIDENCE. Much
like the video-game characters he adored, Musk had leveled up. He had solved Silicon Valley and
become what everyone at the time wanted to be—a dot-com millionaire. His next venture would need
to live up to his rapidly inflating ambition. This left Musk searching for an industry that had tons of
money and inefficiencies that he and the Internet could exploit. Musk began thinking back to his time
as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia. His big takeaway from that job, that bankers are rich and
dumb, now had the feel of a massive opportunity.
During his time working for the head of strategy at the bank in the early 1990s, Musk had been
asked to take a look at the company’s third-world debt portfolio. This pool of money went by the
depressing name of “less-developed country debt,” and Bank of Nova Scotia had billions of dollars
of it. Countries throughout South America and elsewhere had defaulted in the years prior, forcing the
bank to write down some of its debt value. Musk’s boss wanted him to dig into the bank’s holdings as
a learning experiment and try to determine how much the debt was actually worth.
While pursuing this project, Musk stumbled upon what seemed like an obvious business
opportunity. The United States had tried to help reduce the debt burden of a number of developing
countries through so-called Brady bonds, in which the U.S. government basically backstopped the
debt of countries like Brazil and Argentina. Musk noticed an arbitrage play. “I calculated the backstop
value, and it was something like fifty cents on the dollar, while the actual debt was trading at twentyfive cents,” Musk said. “This was like the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize it.”
Musk tried to remain cool and calm as he rang Goldman Sachs, one of the main traders in this market,
and probed around about what he had seen. He inquired as to how much Brazilian debt might be
available at the 25-cents price. “The guy said, ‘How much do you want?’ and I came up with some
ridiculous number like ten billion dollars,” Musk said. When the trader confirmed that was doable,
Musk hung up the phone. “I was thinking that they had to be fucking crazy because you could double
your money. Everything was backed by Uncle Sam. It was a no-brainer.”
Musk had spent the summer earning about fourteen dollars an hour and getting chewed out for
using the executive coffee machine, among other status infractions, and figured his moment to shine
and make a big bonus had arrived. He sprinted up to his boss’s office and pitched the opportunity of a
lifetime. “You can make billions of dollars for free,” he said. His boss told Musk to write up a report,
which soon got passed up to the bank’s CEO, who promptly rejected the proposal, saying the bank
had been burned on Brazilian and Argentinian debt before and didn’t want to mess with it again. “I
tried to tell them that’s not the point,” Musk said. “The point is that it’s fucking backed by Uncle Sam.
It doesn’t matter what the South Americans do. You cannot lose unless you think the U.S. Treasury is
going to default. But they still didn’t do it, and I was stunned. Later in life, as I competed against the
banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave me confidence. All the bankers did was copy
what everyone else did. If everyone else ran off a bloody cliff, they’d run right off a cliff with them. If
there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was picking it up, theywouldn’t pick it up, either.”
In the years that followed, Musk considered starting an Internet bank and discussed it openly
during his internship at Pinnacle Research in 1995. The youthful Musk lectured the scientists about the
inevitable transition coming in finance toward online systems, but they tried to talk him down, saying
that it would takes ages for Web security to be good enough to win over consumers. Musk, though,
remained convinced that the finance industry could do with a major upgrade and that he could have a
big influence on banking with a relatively small investment. “Money is low bandwidth,” he said,
during a speech at Stanford University in 2003, to describe his thinking. “You don’t need some sort of
big infrastructure improvement to do things with it. It’s really just an entry in a database.”
The actual plan that Musk concocted was beyond grandiose. As the researchers at Pinnacle had
pointed out, people were barely comfortable buying books online. They might take their chances
entering a credit card number but exposing just their bank accounts to the Web was out of the question
to many. Pah. So what? Musk wanted to build a full-service financial institution online: a company
that would have savings and checking accounts as well as brokerage services and insurance. The
technology to build such a service was possible, but navigating the regulatory hell of creating an
online bank from scratch looked like an intractable problem to optimists and an impossibility to more
level heads. This was not dishing out directions to a pizzeria or putting up a house listing. It was
dealing with people’s finances, and there would be real repercussions if the service did not work as
billed.
Undaunted, Musk kicked this new plan into action before Zip2 had even been sold. He chatted up
some of the best engineers at the company to get a feel for who might be willing to join him in another
venture. Musk also bounced his ideas off some contacts he’d made at the bank in Canada. In January
1999, with Zip2’s board seeking a buyer, Musk began to formalize his banking plan. The deal with
Compaq was announced the next month. And in March, Musk incorporated X.com, a finance start-up
with a pornographic-sounding name.
It had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian backpacker to becoming a
multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With his $22 million, he moved from sharing an
apartment with three roommates to buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also
bought a $1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly. Musk embraced
the newfound celebrity that he’d earned as part of the dot-com millionaire set. He let CNN show up at
his apartment at 7 A.M. to film the delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of
Musk’s place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street, while Musk stood slackjawed with his arms folded. “There are sixty-two McLarens in the world, and I will own one of
them,” he told CNN. “Wow, I can’t believe it’s actually here. That’s pretty wild, man.”
CNN interspersed video of the car delivery with interviews with Musk. The whole time he
looked like a caricature of an engineer who had made it big. Musk’s hair had started thinning, and he
had a closely cropped cut that accentuated his boyish face. He wore an all-too-big brown sport coat
and checked his cell phone from his lavish car, sitting next to his gorgeous girlfriend, Justine, and he
seemed spellbound by his life. Musk rolled out one laughable rich-guy line after another, talking first
about the Zip2 deal—“Receiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a large number of Ben
Franklins”—next about the awesomeness of his life—“There it is, gentlemen, the fastest car in the
world”—and then about his prodigious ambition—“I could go and buy one of the islands in the
Bahamas and turn it into my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build andcreate a new company.” The camera crew followed Musk to the X.com offices, where his cocksure
delivery led to another round of cringe-worthy statements: “I do not fit the picture of a banker,”
“Raising fifty million dollars is a matter of making a series of phone calls, and the money is there,” “I
think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.”
Musk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car away from Ralph Lauren,
who had also inquired about buying it. Even very wealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve
something like a McLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He drove it
all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com offices. His friends were horrified
to see such a work of art covered with bird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway. One day,
Musk e-mailed fellow McLaren owner Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of the software maker
Oracle, out of the blue to see if he wanted to go race cars around a track for fun. Jim Clark, another
billionaire who liked fast things, caught wind of the proposal and told a friend that he needed to rush
over to the local Ferrari dealership to buy something that could compete. Musk had joined the big
boys’ club. “Elon was super-excited about all of this,” said George Zachary, a venture capitalist and
close friend of Musk’s. “He showed me the correspondence with Larry.” The next year, while driving
down Sand Hill Road to meet with an investor, Musk turned to a friend in the car and said, “Watch
this.” He floored the car, did a lane change, spun out, and hit an embankment, which started the car
spinning in midair like a Frisbee. The windows and wheels were blown to smithereens, and the body
of the car damaged. Musk again turned to his companion and said, “The funny part is it wasn’t
insured.” The two of them then thumbed a ride to the venture capitalist’s office.
To his credit, Musk did not fully buy in to this playboy persona. He actually plowed the majority
of the money he made from Zip2 into X.com. There were practical reasons for this decision. Investors
catch a break under the tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of months.
But even by Silicon Valley’s high-risk standards, it was shocking to put so much of one’s newfound
wealth into something as iffy as an online bank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into
X.com, leaving him, after taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. “That’s part of what separates
Elon from mere mortals,” said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive, who went on to cofound X.com.
“He’s willing to take an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays
off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.”
Musk’s decision to invest so much money in X.com looks even more unusual in hindsight. Much of
the point of being a dot-com success in 1999 was to prove yourself once, stash away your millions,
and then use your credentials to talk other people into betting their money on your next venture. Musk
would certainly go on to rely on outside investors, but he put major skin in the game as well. So while
Musk could be found on television talking like the rest of the self-absorbed dot-com schmucks, he
behaved more like a throwback to Silicon Valley’s earlier days, when the founders of companies like
Intel were willing to take huge gambles on themselves.
Where Zip2 had been a neat, useful idea, X.com held the promise of fomenting a major revolution.
Musk, for the first time, would be confronting a deep-pocketed, entrenched industry head-on with the
hopes of upending all of the incumbents. Musk also began to hone his trademark style of entering an
ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he knew very little about the industry’s nuances
bother him in the slightest. He had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he
could run the business better than everyone else. Musk’s ego and confidence had started heading
toward the levels that would inspire some and leave others thinking of him as pompous andunscrupulous. The creation of X.com would ultimately reveal a great deal about Musk’s creativity,
relentless drive, confrontational style, and foibles as a leader. Musk would also get another taste of
being pushed aside at his own company and the pain that accompanies a grand vision left unfulfilled.
Musk assembled what looked like an all-star crew to start X.com. Ho had worked at SGI and
Zip2 as an engineer, and his peers marveled at his coding and team-management skills. They were
joined by a pair of Canadians with finance experience—Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne. Musk
had met Fricker during his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the two really hit it off. A
Rhodes scholar, Fricker brought the knowledge of the banking world’s mechanics that X.com would
need. Payne was Fricker’s friend from the Canadian finance community. All four men were
considered cofounders of the company, while Musk emerged as the largest shareholder thanks to his
hefty up-front investment. X.com began, like so many Silicon Valley operations, at a house where the
cofounders began brainstorming, and then moved to more formal offices at 394 University Avenue in
Palo Alto.
The cofounders were aligned philosophically around the idea that the banking industry had fallen
behind the times. Visiting a branch bank to speak with a teller seemed pretty archaic now that the
Internet had arrived. The rhetoric sounded good, and the four men were enthused. The only thing
stopping them was reality. Musk had a modicum of banking experience and had resorted to buying a
book on the industry to help understand its inner workings. The more the cofounders thought about
their plan of attack, the more they realized the regulatory issues blocking the creation of an online
bank were insurmountable. “As four and five months went by, the onion just kept unwrapping,” said
Ho.*
From the outset, there were personality clashes as well. Musk had become a budding superstar in
Silicon Valley and had the press fawning over him. This didn’t sit that well with Fricker, who’d
moved from Canada and pegged X.com as his chance to make a mark on the world as a banking whiz.
Fricker, according to numerous people, wanted to run X.com and do so in a more conventional
manner. He found Musk’s visionary statements to the press about rethinking the entire banking industry
silly since the company was struggling to build much of anything. “We were out promising the sun,
moon, and the stars to the media,” Fricker said. “Elon would say that this is not a normal business
environment, and you have to suspend normal business thinking. He said, ‘There is a happy-gas
factory up on the hill, and it’s pumping stuff into the Valley.’” Fricker would not be the last person to
accuse Musk of overhyping products and playing the public, although whether this is a flaw or one of
Musk’s great talents as a businessman is up for debate.
The squabble between Fricker and Musk came to a quick, nasty end. Just five months after X.com
had started, Fricker initiated a coup. “He said either he takes over as CEO or he’s just going to take
everyone from the company and create his own company,” Musk said. “I don’t do well with
blackmail. I said, ‘You should go do that.’ So he did.” Musk tried to talk Ho and some of the other key
engineers into staying, but they sided with Fricker and left. Musk ended up with a shell of a company
and a handful of loyal employees. “After all that went down, I remember sitting with Elon in his
office,” said Julie Ankenbrandt, an early X.com employee who stayed. “There were a million laws in
place to block something like X.com from happening, but Elon didn’t care. He just looked at me and
said, ‘I guess we should hire some more people.’”*
Musk had been trying to raise funding for X.com and had been forced to go to venture capitalists
and confess that there wasn’t much in the way of a company left. Mike Moritz, a famed investor fromSequoia Capital, backed the company nonetheless, making a bet on Musk and little else. Musk hit the
streets of Silicon Valley once again and managed to attract engineers with his rah-rah speeches about
the future of Internet banking. Scott Anderson, a young computer scientist, started on August 1, 1999,
just a few days after the exodus, and bought right into the vision. “You look back, and it was total
insanity,” Anderson said. “We had what amounted to a Hollywood movie set of a website. It barely
got past the VCs.”
Week by week, more engineers arrived and the vision became more real. The company secured a
banking license and a mutual fund license and formed a partnership with Barclays. By November,
X.com’s small software team had created one of the world’s first online banks complete with FDIC
insurance to back the bank accounts and three mutual funds for investors to choose. Musk gave the
engineers $100,000 of his own money to conduct their testing. On the night before Thanksgiving in
1999, X.com went live to the public. “I was there until two A.M.,” Anderson said. “Then, I went home
to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Elon called me a few hours later and asked me to come into the office to
relieve some of the other engineers. Elon stayed there forty-eight straight hours, making sure things
worked.”
Under Musk’s direction, X.com tried out some radical banking concepts. Customers received a
$20 cash card just for signing up to use the service and a $10 card for every person they referred.
Musk did away with niggling fees and overdraft penalties. In a very modern twist, X.com also built a
person-to-person payment system in which you could send someone money just by plugging their email address into the site. The whole idea was to shift away from slow-moving banks with their
mainframes taking days to process payments and to create a kind of agile bank account where you
could move money around with a couple of clicks on a mouse or an e-mail. This was revolutionary
stuff, and more than 200,000 people bought into it and signed up for X.com within the first couple of
months of operation.
Soon enough, X.com had a major competitor. A couple of brainy kids named Max Levchin and
Peter Thiel had been working on a payment system of their own at their start-up called Confinity. The
duo actually rented their office space—a glorified broom closet—from X.com and were trying to
make it possible for owners of Palm Pilot handhelds to swap money via the infrared ports on the
devices. Between X.com and Confinity, the small office on University Avenue had turned into the
frenzied epicenter of the Internet finance revolution. “It was this mass of adolescent men that worked
so hard,” Ankenbrandt said. “It stunk so badly in there. I can still smell it—leftover pizza, body odor,
and sweat.”
The pleasantries between X.com and Confinity came to an abrupt end. The Confinity founders
moved to an office down the street and, like X.com, began focusing their attention on Web and e-mailbased payments with their service known as PayPal. The companies became locked in a heated battle
to match each other’s features and attract more users, knowing that whoever got bigger faster would
win. Tens of millions of dollars were spent on promotions, while millions more were lost battling
hackers who had seized upon the services as new playgrounds for fraud. “It was like the Internet
version of making it rain at a strip club,” said Jeremy Stoppelman, an X.com engineer who went on to
become the CEO of Yelp. “You gave away money as fast as you could.”
The race to win Internet payments gave Musk a chance to show off his quick thinking and work
ethic. He kept devising plans to counter the advantage PayPal had established on auction sites like
eBay. And he rallied the X.com employees to implement the tactics as fast as possible using bruteforce appeals to their competitive natures. “There really wasn’t anything suave about him,”
Ankenbrandt said. “We all worked twenty hours a day, and he worked twenty-three hours.”
In March 2000, X.com and Confinity finally decided to stop trying to spend each other into
oblivion and to join forces. Confinity had what looked like the hottest product in PayPal but was
paying out $100,000 a day in awards to new customers and didn’t have the cash reserves to keep
going. X.com, by contrast, still had plenty of cash reserves and the more sophisticated banking
products. It took the lead in setting the merger terms, leaving Musk as the largest shareholder of the
combined company, which would be called X.com. Shortly after the deal closed, X.com raised $100
million from backers including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs and boasted that it had more than
one million customers.*
The two companies tried hard to mesh their cultures, with modest success. Groups of employees
from X.com tied their computer monitors to their desk chairs with power cords and rolled them down
the street to the Confinity offices to work alongside their new colleagues. But the teams could never
quite see eye to eye. Musk kept championing the X.com brand, while most everyone else favored
PayPal. More fights broke out over the design of the company’s technology infrastructure. The
Confinity team led by Levchin favored moving toward open-source software like Linux, while Musk
championed Microsoft’s data-center software as being more likely to keep productivity high. This
squabble may sound silly to outsiders, but it was the equivalent of a religious war to the engineers,
many of whom viewed Microsoft as a dated evil empire and Linux as the modern software of the
people. Two months after the merger, Thiel resigned and Levchin threatened to walk out over the
technology rift. Musk was left to run a fractured company.
The technology issues X.com had been facing worsened as the computing systems failed to keep
up with an exploding customer base. Once a week, the company’s website collapsed. Most of the
engineers were ordered to start work designing a new system, which distracted key technical
personnel and left X.com vulnerable to fraud. “We were losing money hand over fist,” said
Stoppelman. As X.com became more popular and its transaction volume exploded, all of its problems
worsened. There was more fraud. There were more fees from banks and credit card companies.
There was more competition from start-ups. X.com lacked a cohesive business model to offset the
losses and turn a profit from the money it managed. Roelof Botha, the start-up’s chief financial officer
and now a prominent venture capitalist at Sequoia, did not think Musk provided the board with a true
picture of X.com’s issues. A growing number of other people at the company questioned Musk’s
decision-making in the face of all the crises.
What followed was one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley’s long, illustrious history of nasty
coups. A small group of X.com employees gathered one night at Fanny & Alexander, a now-defunct
bar in Palo Alto, and brainstormed about how to push out Musk. They decided to sell the board on the
idea of Thiel returning as CEO. Instead of confronting Musk directly with this plan, the conspirators
decided to take action behind Musk’s back.
Musk and Justine had been married in January 2000 but had been too busy for a honeymoon. Nine
months later, in September, they planned to mix business and pleasure by going on a fund-raising trip
and ending it with a honeymoon in Sydney to catch the Olympics. As they boarded their flight one
night, X.com executives delivered letters of no confidence to X.com’s board. Some of the people
loyal to Musk had sensed something was wrong, but it was too late. “I went to the office at ten thirty
that night, and everyone was there,” Ankenbrandt said. “I could not believe it. I am frantically tryingto call Elon, but he’s on a plane.” By the time he landed, Musk had been replaced by Thiel.
When Musk finally heard what had happened, he hopped on the next plane back to Palo Alto. “It
was shocking, but I will give Elon this—I thought he handled it pretty well,” Justine said. For a brief
period, Musk tried to fight back. He urged the board to reconsider its decision. But when it became
clear that the company had already moved on, Musk relented. “I talked to Moritz and a few others,”
Musk said. “It wasn’t so much that I wanted to be CEO but more like, ‘Hey, I think there are some
pretty important things that need to happen, and if I’m not CEO, I’m not sure they are going to happen.’
But then I talked to Max and Peter, and it seemed like they would make these things happen. So then, I
mean, it’s not the end of the world.”
Many of the X.com employees who had been with Musk since early on were less than impressed
by what had happened. “I was floored by it and angry,” said Stoppelman. “Elon was sort of a rock
star in my view. I was very vocal about how I thought it was bullshit. But I knew fundamentally that
the company was doing well. It was a rocket ship, and I wasn’t going to leave.” Stoppelman, then
twenty-three, went into a conference room and tore into Thiel and Levchin. “They let me vent it all
out, and their reaction was part of the reason I stayed.” Others remained embittered. “It was
backhanded and cowardly,” said Branden Spikes, a Zip2 and X.com engineer. “I would have been
more behind it if Elon had been in the room.”
By June 2001, Musk’s influence on the company was fading quickly. That month, Thiel rebranded
X.com as PayPal. Musk rarely lets a slight go unpunished. Throughout this ordeal, however, he
showed incredible restraint. He embraced the role of being an advisor to the company and kept
investing in it, increasing his stake as PayPal’s largest shareholder. “You would expect someone in
Elon’s position to be bitter and vindictive, but he wasn’t,” said Botha. “He supported Peter. He was a
prince.”
The next few months would end up being key for Musk’s future. The dot-com joyride was coming
to a quick end, and people wanted to try to cash out in any way possible. When executives from eBay
began approaching PayPal about an acquisition, the inclination for most people was to sell and sell
fast. Musk and Moritz, though, urged the board to reject a number of offers and hold out for more
money. PayPal had revenue of about $240 million per year, and looked like it might make it as an
independent company and go public. Musk and Moritz’s resistance paid off and then some. In July
2002, eBay offered $1.5 billion for PayPal, and Musk and the rest of the board accepted the deal.
Musk netted about $250 million from the sale to eBay, or $180 million after taxes—enough to make
what would turn out to be his very wild dreams possible.
The PayPal episode was a mixed bag for Musk. His reputation as a leader suffered in the
aftermath of the deal, and the media turned on him in earnest for the first time. Eric Jackson, an early
Confinity employee, wrote The PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest
of Planet Earth in 2004 and recounted the company’s tumultuous journey. The book painted Musk as
an egomaniacal, stubborn jerk, making wrong decisions at every turn, and portrayed Thiel and
Levchin as heroic geniuses. Valleywag, the technology industry gossip site, piled on as well and
turned bashing Musk into one of its pet projects. The criticisms grew to the point that people started
wondering aloud whether or not Musk counted as a true cofounder of PayPal or had just ridden
Thiel’s coattails to a magical payday. The tone of the book along with the blog posts goaded Musk in
2007 into writing a 2,200-word e-mail to Valleywag meant to set the record straight with his version
of events.In the e-mail, Musk let his literary flair loose and gave the public a direct look at his combative
side. He described Jackson as “a sycophantic jackass” and “one notch above an intern,” who had
little insight into the high-level goings-on at the company. “Since Eric worships Peter, the outcome
was obvious—Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my role is somewhere between
negligible and a bad seed,” Musk wrote. Musk then detailed seven reasons why he deserved
cofounder status of PayPal, including his role as its largest shareholder, the hiring of a lot of the top
talent, the creation of a number of the company’s most successful business ideas, and his time as CEO
when the company went from sixty to several hundred employees.
Almost everyone I interviewed from the PayPal days leaned toward agreeing with Musk’s overall
assessment. They said that Jackson’s account bordered on fantasy when it came to celebrating the
Confinity team over Musk and the X.com team. “There are a lot of PayPal people that suffer from
warped memories,” said Botha.
But these same people reached another consensus, saying that Musk had mishandled the branding,
technology infrastructure, and fraud situations. “I think it would have killed the company if Elon had
stayed on as CEO for six more months,” said Botha. “The mistakes Elon was making at the time were
amplifying the risk of the business.” (For more on Musk’s take on the PayPal years, see Appendix 2.)
The suggestions that Musk did not count as a “true” cofounder of PayPal seem asinine in
retrospect. Thiel, Levchin, and other PayPal executives have said as much in the years since the eBay
deal closed. The only useful thing such criticisms produced were the bombastic counteroffensives
from Musk, which revealed touches of insecurity and the seriousness with which Musk insists that the
historical record reflect his take on events. “He comes from the school of thought in the public
relations world that you let no inaccuracy go uncorrected,” said Vince Sollitto, the former
communications chief at PayPal. “It sets a precedent, and you should fight every out-of-place comma
tooth and nail. He takes things very personally and usually seeks war.”
The stronger critique of Musk during this period of his life was that he had succeeded to a large
degree despite himself. Musk’s traits as a confrontational know-it-all and his abundant ego created
deep, lasting fractures within his companies. While Musk consciously tried to temper his behavior,
these efforts were not enough to win over investors and more experienced executives. At both Zip2
and PayPal, the companies’ boards came to the conclusion that Musk was not yet CEO material. It can
also be argued that Musk had become a hyperbolic huckster, who overreached and oversold his
companies’ technology. Musk’s biggest detractors have made all of these arguments either in public or
private and a half dozen or so of them said far worse things to me about his character and actions,
describing Musk as unethical in business and vicious with his personal attacks. Almost universally,
these people were unwilling to go on the record with their comments, claiming to be afraid Musk
would pursue litigation against them or ruin their ability to do business.
These criticisms must be weighed against Musk’s track record. He demonstrated an innate ability
to read people and technology trends at the inception of the consumer Web. While others tried to wrap
their heads around the Internet’s implications, Musk had already set off on a purposeful plan of attack.
He envisioned many of the early pieces of technology—directories, maps, sites that focused on
vertical markets—that would become mainstays on the Web. Then, just as people became comfortable
with buying things from Amazon.com and eBay, Musk made the great leap forward to full-fledged
Internet banking. He would bring standard financial instruments online and then modernize the
industry with a host of new concepts. He exhibited a deep insight into human nature that helped hiscompanies pull off exceptional marketing, technology, and financial feats. Musk was already playing
the entrepreneur game at the highest level and working the press and investors like few others could.
Did he hype things up and rub people the wrong way? Absolutely—and with spectacular results.
Based in large part on Musk’s guidance, PayPal survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble,
became the first blockbuster IPO after the 9/11 attacks, and then sold to eBay for an astronomical sum
while the rest of the technology industry was mired in a dramatic downturn. It was nearly impossible
to survive let alone emerge as a winner in the midst of such a mess.
PayPal also came to represent one of the greatest assemblages of business and engineering talent
in Silicon Valley history. Both Musk and Thiel had a keen eye for young, brilliant engineers. The
founders of start-ups as varied as YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp all worked at PayPal.
Another set of people—including Reid Hoffman, Thiel, and Botha—emerged as some of the
technology industry’s top investors. PayPal staff pioneered techniques in fighting online fraud that
have formed the basis of software used by the CIA and FBI to track terrorists and of software used by
the world’s largest banks to combat crime. This collection of super-bright employees has become
known as the PayPal Mafia—more or less the current ruling class of Silicon Valley—and Musk is its
most famous and successful member.
Hindsight also continues to favor Musk’s unbridled vision over the more cautious pragmatism of
executives at Zip2 and PayPal. Had it chased consumers as Musk urged, Zip2 may have ended up as a
blockbuster mapping and review service. As for PayPal, an argument can still be made that the
investors sold out too early and should have listened more to Musk’s demands to remain independent.
By 2014, PayPal had amassed 153 million users and was valued at close to $32 billion as a standalone company. A flood of payment and banking start-ups have appeared as well—Square, Stripe,
and Simple, to name three among the S’s—that have looked to fulfill much of the original X.com
vision.
If X.com’s board had been a bit more patient with Musk, there’s good reason to believe he would
have succeeded with delivery of the “online bank to rule them all” that he had set out to create.
History has demonstrated that while Musk’s goals can sound absurd in the moment, he certainly
believes in them and, when given enough time, tends to achieve them. “He always works from a
different understanding of reality than the rest of us,” Ankenbrandt said. “He is just different than the
rest of us.”
While navigating the business tumult of Zip2 and PayPal, Musk found a moment of peace in his
personal life. He’d spent years courting Justine Wilson from afar, flying her out for visits on the
weekends. For a long time, his oppressive hours and his roommates put a crimp on the relationship.
But the Zip2 sale let Musk buy a place of his own and pay a bit more attention to Justine. Like any
couple, they had their ups and downs, but that passion of young love remained. “We fought a lot, but
when we weren’t fighting, there was a deep sense of compassion—a bond,” Justine said. The couple
had been sparring for a few days about phone calls Justine kept getting from an ex-boyfriend—“Elon
didn’t like that”—and had a major spat while walking near the X.com offices. “I remember thinking it
was a lot of drama, and that if I was going to put up with it, we might as well be married. I told him
he should just propose to me,” Justine said. It took Musk a few minutes to cool down and then he did
just that, proposing on the spot. A few days later, a more chivalrous Musk returned to the sidewalk,
got down on bended knee, and presented Justine with a ring.
Justine knew all about Musk’s grim childhood and the intense range of emotions he could exhibit.Her romantic sensibilities overrode any trepidation she might have had about these parts of Musk’s
history and character and centered instead on his strength. Musk often talked fondly about Alexander
the Great, and Justine saw him as her own conquering hero. “He wasn’t afraid of responsibility,” she
said. “He didn’t run from things. He wanted to get married and have kids early on.” Musk also exuded
a confidence and passion that made Justine think life with him would always be okay. “Money is not
his motivation, and, quite frankly, I think it just happens for him,” Justine said. “It’s just there. He
knows he can generate it.”
At their wedding reception, Justine encountered the other side of the conquering hero. Musk
pulled Justine close while they danced, and informed her, “I am the alpha in this relationship.”3 Two
months later, Justine signed a postnuptial financial agreement that would come back to haunt her and
entered into an enduring power struggle. She described the situation years later in an article for
Marie Claire, writing, “He was constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. ‘I am your
wife,’ I told him repeatedly, ‘not your employee.’ ‘If you were my employee,’ he said just as often, ‘I
would fire you.’”
The newlyweds were not helped by the drama at X.com. They’d put off their honeymoon and then
had it derailed by the coup. It took until late December 2000 for things to calm down enough for Musk
to take his first vacation in years. He arranged a two-week trip, with the first part taking place in
Brazil and the second in South Africa at a game reserve near the Mozambique border. While in
Africa, Musk contracted the most virulent version of malaria—falciparum malaria—which accounts
for the vast majority of malaria deaths.
Musk returned to California in January, which is when the illness took hold. He started to get sick
and was bedridden for a few days before Justine took him to a doctor who then ordered that Musk be
rushed in an ambulance to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City.* Doctors there misdiagnosed and
mistreated his condition to the point that Musk was near death. “Then, there happened to be a guy
visiting from another hospital who had seen a lot more malaria cases,” Musk said. He spied Musk’s
blood work in the lab and ordered an immediate maximum dosage of doxycycline, an antibiotic. The
doctor told Musk that if he had turned up a day later, the medicine likely would no longer have been
effective.
Musk spent ten agonizing days in the intensive care unit. The experience shocked Justine. “He’s
built like a tank,” she said. “He has a level of stamina and an ability to deal with levels of stress that
I’ve never seen in anyone else. To see him laid low like that in total misery was like a visit to an
alternate universe.” It took Musk six months to recover. He lost forty-five pounds over the course of
the illness and had a closet full of clothes that no longer fit. “I came very close to dying,” Musk said.
“That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.”6MICE IN SPACE
ELON MUSK TURNED THIRTY IN JUNE 2001, and the birthday hit him hard. “I’m no longer a
child prodigy,” he told Justine, only half joking. That same month X.com officially changed its name
to PayPal, providing a harsh reminder that the company had been ripped away from Musk and given
to someone else to run. The start-up life, which Musk described as akin to “eating glass and staring
into the abyss,”4 had gotten old and so had Silicon Valley. It felt like Musk was living inside a trade
show where everyone worked in the technology industry and talked all the time about funding, IPOs,
and chasing big paydays. People liked to brag about the crazy hours they worked, and Justine would
just laugh, knowing Musk had lived a more extreme version of the Silicon Valley lifestyle than they
could imagine. “I had friends who complained that their husbands came home at seven or eight,” she
said. “Elon would come home at eleven and work some more. People didn’t always get the sacrifice
he made in order to be where he was.”
The idea of escaping this incredibly lucrative rat race started to grow more and more appealing.
Musk’s entire life had been about chasing a bigger stage, and Palo Alto seemed more like a steppingstone than a final destination. The couple decided to move south and begin their family and the next
chapter of their lives in Los Angeles.
“There’s an element to him that likes the style and the excitement and color of a place like L.A.,”
said Justine. “Elon likes to be where the action is.” A small group of Musk’s friends who felt
similarly had also decamped to Los Angeles for what would be a wild couple of years.
It wasn’t just Los Angeles’s glitz and grandeur that attracted Musk. It was also the call of space.
After being pushed out of PayPal, Musk had started to revisit his childhood fantasies around rocket
ships and space travel and to think that he might have a greater calling than creating Internet services.
The changes in his attitude and thinking soon became obvious to his friends, including a group of
PayPal executives who had gathered in Las Vegas one weekend to celebrate the company’s success.
“We’re all hanging out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some obscure
Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been bought on eBay,” said Kevin
Hartz, an early PayPal investor. “He was studying it and talking openly about space travel and
changing the world.”
Musk had picked Los Angeles with intent. It gave him access to space or at least the space
industry. Southern California’s mild, consistent weather had made it a favored city of the aeronautics
industry since the 1920s, when the Lockheed Aircraft Company set up shop in Hollywood. Howard
Hughes, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, Boeing, and myriad other people and organizations have
performed much of their manufacturing and cutting-edge experimentation in and around Los Angeles.
Today the city remains a major hub for the military’s aeronautics work and commercial activity.
While Musk didn’t know exactly what he wanted to do in space, he realized that just by being in Los
Angeles he would be surrounded by the world’s top aeronautics thinkers. They could help him refine
any ideas, and there would be plenty of recruits to join his next venture.
Musk’s first interactions with the aeronautics community were with an eclectic collection ofspace enthusiasts, members of a nonprofit group called the Mars Society. Dedicated to exploring and
settling the Red Planet, the Mars Society planned to hold a fund-raiser in mid-2001. The $500-perplate event was to take place at the house of one of the well-off Mars Society members, and
invitations to the usual characters had been mailed out. What stunned Robert Zubrin, the head of the
group, was the reply from someone named Elon Musk, whom no one could remember inviting. “He
gave us a check for five thousand dollars,” Zubrin said. “That made everyone take notice.” Zubrin
began researching Musk, determined he was rich, and invited him for coffee ahead of the dinner. “I
wanted to make sure he knew the projects we had under way,” Zubrin said. He proceeded to regale
Musk with tales of the research center the society had built in the Arctic to mimic the tough conditions
of Mars and the experiments they had been running for something called the Translife Mission, in
which there would be a spinning capsule orbiting Earth that was piloted by a crew of mice. “It would
spin to give them one-third gravity—the same you would have on Mars—and they would live there
and reproduce,” Zubrin told Musk.
When it was time for dinner, Zubrin placed Musk at the VIP table next to himself, the director and
space buff James Cameron, and Carol Stoker, a planetary scientist for NASA with a deep interest in
Mars. “Elon is so youthful-looking and at that time he looked like a little boy,” Stoker said. “Cameron
was chatting him up right away to invest in his next movie, and Zubrin was trying to get him to make a
big donation to the Mars Society.” In return for being hounded for cash, Musk probed about for ideas
and contacts. Stoker’s husband was an aerospace engineer at NASA working on a concept for an
airplane that would glide over Mars looking for water. Musk loved that. “He was much more intense
than some of the other millionaires,” Zubrin said. “He didn’t know a lot about space, but he had a
scientific mind. He wanted to know exactly what was being planned in regards to Mars and what the
significance would be.” Musk took to the Mars Society right away and joined its board of directors.
He donated another $100,000 to fund a research station in the desert as well.
Musk’s friends were not entirely sure what to make of his mental state. He’d lost a tremendous
amount of weight fighting off malaria and looked almost skeletal. With little prompting, Musk would
start expounding on his desire to do something meaningful with his life—something lasting. His next
move had to be either in solar or in space. “He said, ‘The logical thing to happen next is solar, but I
can’t figure out how to make any money out of it,’” said George Zachary, the investor and close friend
of Musk’s, recalling a lunch date at the time. “Then he started talking about space, and I thought he
meant office space like a real estate play.” Musk had actually started thinking bigger than the Mars
Society. Rather than send a few mice into Earth’s orbit, Musk wanted to send them to Mars. Some
very rough calculations done at the time suggested that the journey would cost $15 million. “He asked
if I thought that was crazy,” Zachary said. “I asked, ‘Do the mice come back? Because, if they don’t,
yeah, most people will think that’s crazy.’” As it turned out, the mice were not only meant to go to
Mars and come back but were also meant to procreate along the way, during a journey that would take
months. Jeff Skoll, another one of Musk’s friends who made a fortune at eBay, pointed out that the
fornicating mice would need a hell of a lot of cheese and bought Musk a giant wheel of Le Brouère, a
type of Gruyère.
Musk did not mind becoming the butt of cheese jokes. The more he thought about space, the more
important its exploration seemed to him. He felt as if the public had lost some of its ambition and
hope for the future. The average person might see space exploration as a waste of time and effort and
rib him for talking about the subject, but Musk thought about interplanetary travel in a very earnestway. He wanted to inspire the masses and reinvigorate their passion for science, conquest, and the
promise of technology.
His fears that mankind had lost much of its will to push the boundaries were reinforced one day
when Musk went to the NASA website. He’d expected to find a detailed plan for exploring Mars and
instead found bupkis. “At first I thought, jeez, maybe I’m just looking in the wrong place,” Musk once
told Wired. “Why was there no plan, no schedule? There was nothing. It seemed crazy.” Musk
believed that the very idea of America was intertwined with humanity’s desire to explore. He found it
sad that the American agency tasked with doing audacious things in space and exploring new frontiers
as its mission seemed to have no serious interest in investigating Mars at all. The spirit of Manifest
Destiny had been deflated or maybe even come to a depressing end, and hardly anyone seemed to
care.
Like so many quests to revitalize America’s soul and bring hope to all of mankind, Musk’s
journey began in a hotel conference room. By this time, Musk had built up a decent network of
contacts in the space industry, and he brought the best of them together at a series of salons—
sometimes at the Renaissance hotel at the Los Angeles airport and sometimes at the Sheraton hotel in
Palo Alto. Musk had no formal business plan for these people to debate. He mostly wanted them to
help him develop the mice-to-Mars idea or at least to come up with something comparable. Musk
hoped to hit on a grand gesture for mankind—some type of event that would capture the world’s
attention, get people thinking about Mars again, and have them reflect on man’s potential. The
scientists and luminaries at the meetings were to figure out a spectacle that would be technically
feasible at a price tag of approximately $20 million. Musk resigned from his position as a director of
the Mars Society and announced his own organization—the Life to Mars Foundation.
The collection of talent attending these sessions in 2001 was impressive. Scientists showed up
from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or JPL. James Cameron appeared, lending some celebrity to
the affair. Also attending was Michael Griffin, whose academic credentials were spectacular and
included degrees in aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and applied
physics. Griffin had worked for the CIA’s venture capital arm called In-Q-Tel, at NASA, and at JPL
and was just in the process of leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and
spacecraft, where he had been chief technical officer and the general manager of the space systems
group. It could be argued that no one on the planet knew more about the realities of getting things into
space than Griffin, and he was working for Musk as space thinker in chief. (Four years later, in 2005,
Griffin took over as head of NASA.)
The experts were thrilled to have another rich guy appear who was willing to fund something
interesting in space. They happily debated the merits and feasibility of sending up rodents and
watching them hump. But, as the discussion wore on, a consensus started to build around pursuing a
different project—something called “Mars Oasis.” Under this plan, Musk would buy a rocket and use
it to shoot what amounted to a robotic greenhouse to Mars. A group of researchers had already been
working on a space-ready growth chamber for plants. The idea was to modify their structure, so that it
could open up briefly and suck in some of the Martian regolith, or soil, and then use it to grow a plant,
which would in turn produce the first oxygen on Mars. Much to Musk’s liking, this new plan seemed
both ostentatious and feasible.
Musk wanted the structure to have a window and a way to send a video feedback to Earth, so that
people could watch the plant grow. The group also talked about sending out kits to students around thecountry who would grow their own plants simultaneously and take notice, for example, that the
Martian plant could grow twice as high as its Earth-bound counterpart in the same amount of time.
“This concept had been floating around in various forms for a while,” said Dave Bearden, a space
industry veteran who attended the meetings. “It would be, yes, there is life on Mars, and we put it
there. The hope was that it might turn on a light for thousands of kids that this place is not that hostile.
Then they might start thinking, Maybe we should go there.” Musk’s enthusiasm for the idea started to
inspire the group, many of whom had grown cynical about anything novel happening in space again.
“He’s a very smart, very driven guy with a huge ego,” Bearden said. “At one point someone
mentioned that he might become Time magazine’s Man of the Year, and you could see him light up. He
has this belief that he is the guy who can change the world.”
The main thing troubling the space experts was Musk’s budget. Following the salons, it seemed
like Musk wanted to spend somewhere between $20 million and $30 million on the stunt, and
everyone knew that the cost of a rocket launch alone would eat up that money and then some. “In my
mind, you needed two hundred million dollars to do it right,” Bearden said. “But people were
reluctant to bring too much reality into the situation too early and just get the whole idea killed.” Then
there were the immense engineering challenges that would need solving. “To have a big window on
this thing was a real thermal problem,” Bearden said. “You could not keep the container warm enough
to keep anything alive.” Scooping Martian soil into the structure seemed not only hard to do
physically but also like a flat-out bad idea since the regolith would be toxic. For a while, the
scientists debated growing the plant in a nutrient-rich gel instead, but that felt like cheating and like it
might undermine the whole point of the endeavor. Even the optimistic moments were awash in
unknowns. One scientist found some very resilient mustard seeds and thought they could possibly
survive a treated version of the Martian soil. “There was a pretty big downside if the plant didn’t
survive,” Bearden said. “You have this dead garden on Mars that ends up giving off the opposite of
the intended effect.”*
Musk never flinched. He turned some of the volunteer thinkers into consultants, and put them to
work on the plant machine’s design. He also plotted a trip to Russia to find out exactly how much a
launch would cost. Musk intended to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM,
from the Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help with this, Musk reached out to Jim
Cantrell, an unusual fellow who had done a mix of classified and unclassified work for the United
States and other governments. Among other claims to fame, Cantrell had been accused of espionage
and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians after a satellite deal went awry. “After a
couple of weeks, Al Gore made some calls, and it got worked out,” Cantrell said. “I didn’t want
anything to do with the Russians again—ever.” Musk had other ideas.
Cantrell was driving his convertible on a hot July evening in Utah when a call came in. “This guy
in a funny accent said, ‘I really need to talk to you. I am a billionaire. I am going to start a space
program.’” Cantrell could not hear Musk well—he thought his name was Ian Musk—and said he
would call back once he got home. The two men didn’t exactly trust each other at the outset. Musk
refused to give Cantrell his cell phone number and made the call from his fax machine. Cantrell found
Musk both intriguing and all too eager. “He asked if there was an airport near me and if I could meet
the next day,” Cantrell said. “My red flags started going off.” Fearing one of his enemies was trying to
orchestrate an elaborate setup, Cantrell told Musk to meet him at the Salt Lake City airport, where he
would rent a conference room near the Delta lounge. “I wanted him to meet me behind security so hecouldn’t pack a gun,” Cantrell said. When the meeting finally took place, Musk and Cantrell hit it off.
Musk rolled out his “humans need to become a multiplanetary species” speech, and Cantrell said that
if Musk was really serious, he’d be willing to go to Russia—again—and help buy a rocket.
In late October 2001, Musk, Cantrell, and Adeo Ressi, Musk’s friend from college, boarded a
commercial flight to Moscow. Ressi had been playing the role of Musk’s guardian and trying to
ascertain whether his best friend had started to lose his mind. Compilation videos of rockets
exploding were made, and interventions were held with Musk’s friends trying to talk him out of
wasting his money. While these measures failed, Adeo went along to Russia to try to contain Musk as
best as he could. “Adeo would call me to the side and say, ‘What Elon is doing is insane. A
philanthropic gesture? That’s crazy,’” Cantrell said. “He was seriously worried but was down with
the trip.” And why not? The men were heading to Russia at the height of its freewheeling post-Soviet
days when rich guys could apparently buy space missiles on the open market.
Team Musk would grow to include Mike Griffin, and meet with the Russians three times over a
period of four months.* The group set up a few meetings with companies like NPO Lavochkin, which
had made probes intended for Mars and Venus for the Russian Federal Space Agency, and Kosmotras,
a commercial rocket launcher. The appointments all seemed to go the same way, following Russian
decorum. The Russians, who often skip breakfast, would ask to meet around 11 A.M. at their offices
for an early lunch. Then there would be small talk for an hour or more as the meeting attendees picked
over a spread of sandwiches, sausages, and, of course, vodka. At some point during this process,
Griffin usually started to lose his patience. “He suffers fools very poorly,” Cantrell said. “He’s
looking around and wondering when we’re going to get down to fucking business.” The answer was
not soon. After lunch came a lengthy smoking and coffee-drinking period. Once all of the tables were
cleared, the Russian in charge would turn to Musk and ask, “What is it you’re interested in buying?”
The big windup may not have bothered Musk as much if the Russians had taken him more seriously.
“They looked at us like we were not credible people,” Cantrell said. “One of their chief designers
spit on me and Elon because he thought we were full of shit.”
The most intense meeting occurred in an ornate, neglected, prerevolutionary building near
downtown Moscow. The vodka shots started—“To space!” “To America!”—while Musk sat on $20
million, which he hoped would be enough to buy three ICBMs that could be retooled to go to space.
Buzzed from the vodka, Musk asked point-blank how much a missile would cost. The reply: $8
million each. Musk countered, offering $8 million for two. “They sat there and looked at him,”
Cantrell said. “And said something like, ‘Young boy. No.’ They also intimated that he didn’t have the
money.” At this point, Musk had decided the Russians were either not serious about doing business or
determined to part a dot-com millionaire from as much of his money as possible. He stormed out of
the meeting.
The Team Musk mood could not have been worse. It was near the end of February 2002, and they
went outside to hail a cab and drove straight to the airport surrounded by the snow and dreck of the
Moscow winter. Inside the cab, no one talked. Musk had come to Russia filled with optimism about
putting on a great show for mankind and was now leaving exasperated and disappointed by human
nature. The Russians were the only ones with rockets that could possibly fit within Musk’s budget. “It
was a long drive,” Cantrell said. “We sat there in silence looking at the Russian peasants shopping in
the snow.” The somber mood lingered all the way to the plane, until the drink cart arrived. “You
always feel particularly good when the wheels lift off in Moscow,” Cantrell said. “It’s like, ‘My God.I made it.’ So, Griffin and I got drinks and clinked our glasses.” Musk sat in the row in front of them,
typing on his computer. “We’re thinking, Fucking nerd. What can he be doing now?” At which point
Musk wheeled around and flashed a spreadsheet he’d created. “Hey, guys,” he said, “I think we can
build this rocket ourselves.”
Griffin and Cantrell had downed a couple of drinks by this time and were too deflated to entertain
a fantasy. They knew all too well the stories of gung-ho millionaires who thought they could conquer
space only to lose their fortunes. Just the year before, Andrew Beal, a real estate and finance whiz in
Texas, folded his aerospace company after having poured millions into a massive test site. “We’re
thinking, Yeah, you and whose fucking army,” Cantrell said. “But, Elon says, ‘No, I’m serious. I have
this spreadsheet.’” Musk passed his laptop over to Griffin and Cantrell, and they were dumbfounded.
The document detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket.
According to Musk’s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modestsized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and
research payloads to space. The spreadsheet also laid out the hypothetical performance
characteristics of the rocket in fairly impressive detail. “I said, ‘Elon, where did you get this?’”
Cantrell said.
Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell
and others, he’d borrowed Rocket Propulsion Elements, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics, and
Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion, along with several more seminal texts.
Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this
meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made much cheaper than
what the Russians were offering. Forget the mice. Forget the plant with its own video feed growing—
or possibly dying—on Mars. Musk would inspire people to think about exploring space again by
making it cheaper to explore space.
As word traveled around the space community about Musk’s plans, there was a collective hohum. People like Zubrin had seen this show many times before. “There was a string of zillionaires
that got sold a good story by an engineer,” Zubrin said. “Combine my brains and your money, and we
can build a rocket ship that will be profitable and open up the space frontier. The techies usually
ended up spending the rich guy’s money for two years, and then the rich guy gets bored and shuts the
thing down. With Elon, everyone gave a sigh and said, ‘Oh well. He could have spent ten million
dollars to send up the mice, but instead he’ll spend hundreds of millions and probably fail like all the
others that proceeded him.’”
While well aware of the risks tied to starting a rocket company, Musk had at least one reason to
think he might succeed where others had failed. That reason’s name was Tom Mueller.
Mueller grew up the son of a logger in the tidy Idaho town of St. Maries, where he developed a
reputation as an oddball. While the rest of the kids were outside exploring the woods in winter,
Mueller stayed warm in the library reading books or watching Star Trek at his house. He also
tinkered. Walking to grade school one day, Mueller discovered a smashed clock in an alley and turned
it into a pet project. Each day, he fixed some part of the clock—a gear, a spring—until he got it
working. A similar thing happened with the family’s lawn mower, which Mueller disassembled one
afternoon on the front lawn for fun. “My dad came home and was so mad because he thought he’d
have to buy a new mower,” Mueller said. “But I put it back together, and it ran.” Mueller then got
stuck on rockets. He started buying mail order kits and following the instructions to build smallrockets. Rather quickly, Mueller graduated to constructing his own devices. At the age of twelve, he
crafted a mock-up space shuttle that could be attached to a rocket, sent up into the air, and then glide
back to the ground. For a science project a couple of years later, Mueller borrowed his dad’s
oxyacetylene welding equipment to make a rocket engine prototype. Mueller cooled the device by
placing it upside down in a coffee can full of water—“I could run it like that all day long”—and
invented equally creative ways to measure its performance. The machine was good enough for
Mueller to win a couple of regional science fair competitions and end up at an international event.
“That’s where I promptly got my ass kicked,” Mueller said.
Tall, lanky, and with a rectangular face, Mueller is an easygoing sort who muddled through
college for a bit, teaching his friends how to make smoke bombs, and then eventually settled down
and did well as a mechanical engineering student. Fresh out of college, he worked for Hughes
Aircraft on satellites—“It wasn’t rockets, but it was close”—and then went to TRW Space &
Electronics. It was the latter half of the 1980s, and Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars program had the space
gearheads dreaming about kinetic weapons and all sorts of mayhem. At TRW, Mueller experimented
with crazy types of propellants and oversaw the development of the company’s TR-106 engine, a
giant machine fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen. As a hobby, Mueller hung out with a couple
hundred amateur rocketry buffs in the Reaction Research Society, a group formed in 1943 to
encourage the building and firing of rockets. On the weekends, Mueller traveled out to the Mojave
Desert with the other RRS members to push the limits of amateur machines. Mueller was one of the
club’s standouts, able to build things that actually worked, and could experiment with some of the
more radical concepts that were quashed by his conservative bosses at TRW. His crowning
achievement was an eighty-pound engine that could produce thirteen thousand pounds of thrust and
earned accolades as the world’s largest liquid-fuel rocket engine built by an amateur. “I still keep the
rockets hanging in my garage,” Mueller said.
In January 2002, Mueller was hanging out in the workshop of John Garvey, who had left a job at
the aerospace company McDonnell Douglas to start building his own rockets. Garvey’s facility was
in Huntington Beach, where he rented an industrial space about the size of a six-car garage. The two
men were fiddling around with the eighty-pound engine when Garvey mentioned that a guy named
Elon Musk might be stopping by. The amateur rocketry scene is tight, and it was Cantrell who
recommended that Musk check out Garvey’s workshop and see Mueller’s designs. On a Sunday, Musk
arrived with a pregnant Justine, wearing a stylish black leather trench coat and looking like a highpaid assassin. Mueller had the eighty-pound engine on his shoulder and was trying to bolt it to a
support structure when Musk began peppering him with questions. “He asked me how much thrust it
had,” Mueller said. “He wanted to know if I had ever worked on anything bigger. I told him that yeah,
I’d worked on a 650,000-pound thrust engine at TRW and knew every part of it.” Mueller set the
engine down and tried to keep up with Musk’s interrogation. “How much would that big engine cost?”
Musk asked. Mueller told him TRW built it for about $12 million. Musk shot back, “Yeah, but how
much could you really do it for?”
Mueller ended up chatting with Musk for hours. The next weekend, Mueller invited Musk to his
house to continue their discussion. Musk knew he had found someone who really knew the ins and
outs of making rockets. After that, Musk introduced Mueller to the rest of his roundtable of space
experts and their stealthy meetings. The caliber of the people impressed Mueller, who had turned
down past job offers from Beal and other budding space magnates because of their borderline insaneideas. Musk, by contrast, seemed to know what he was doing, weeding out the naysayers meeting by
meeting and forming a crew of bright, committed engineers.
Mueller had helped Musk fill out that spreadsheet around the performance and cost metrics of a
new, low-cost rocket, and, along with the rest of Team Musk, had subsequently refined the idea. The
rocket would not carry truck-sized satellites like some of the monster rockets flown by Boeing,
Lockheed, the Russians, and others countries. Instead, Musk’s rocket would be aimed at the lower end
of the satellite market, and it could end up as ideal for an emerging class of smaller payloads that
capitalized on the massive advances that had taken place in recent years in computing and electronics
technology. The rocket would cater directly to a theory in the space industry that a whole new market
might open for both commercial and research payloads if a company could drastically lower the price
per launch and perform launches on a regular schedule. Musk relished the idea of being at the
forefront of this trend and developing the workhorse of a new era in space. Of course, all of this was
theoretical—and then, suddenly, it wasn’t. PayPal had gone public in February with its shares
shooting up 55 percent, and Musk knew that eBay wanted to buy the company as well. While noodling
on the rocket idea, Musk’s net worth had increased from tens of millions to hundreds of millions. In
April 2002, Musk fully abandoned the publicity-stunt idea and committed to building a commercial
space venture. He pulled aside Cantrell, Griffin, Mueller, and Chris Thompson, an aerospace
engineer at Boeing, and told the group, “I want to do this company. If you guys are in, let’s do it.”
(Griffin wanted to join but ended up declining when Musk rebuffed his request to live on the East
Coast, and Cantrell only stuck around for a few months after this meeting, seeing the venture as too
risky.)
Founded in June 2002, Space Exploration Technologies came to life in humble settings. Musk
acquired an old warehouse at 1310 East Grand Avenue in El Segundo, a suburb of Los Angeles
humming with the activity of the aerospace industry. The previous tenant of the 75,000-square-foot
building had done lots of shipping and had used the south side of the facility as a logistics depot,
outfitting it with several receiving bays for delivery trucks. This allowed Musk to drive his silver
McLaren right into the building. Beyond that the surroundings were sparse—just a dusty floor and a
forty-foot-high ceiling with its wooden beams and insulation exposed and which curved at the top to
give the place a hangarlike feel. The north side of the building was an office space with cubicles and
room for about fifty people. During the first week of SpaceX’s operations, delivery trucks showed up
packed full of Dell laptops and printers and folding tables that would serve as the first desks. Musk
walked over to one of the loading docks, rolled up the door, and off-loaded the equipment himself.
Musk had soon transformed the SpaceX office with what has become his signature factory
aesthetic: a glossy epoxy coating applied over concrete on the floors, and a fresh coat of white paint
slathered onto the walls. The white color scheme was intended to make the factory look clean and
feel cheerful. Desks were interspersed around the factory so that Ivy League computer scientists and
engineers designing the machines could sit with the welders and machinists building the hardware.
This approach stood as SpaceX’s first major break with traditional aerospace companies that prefer
to cordon different engineering groups off from each other and typically separate engineers and
machinists by thousands of miles by placing their factories in locations where real estate and labor
run cheap.
As the first dozen or so employees came to the offices, they were told that SpaceX’s mission
would be to emerge as the “Southwest Airlines of Space.” SpaceX would build its own engines andthen contract with suppliers for the other components of the rocket. The company would gain an edge
over the competition by building a better, cheaper engine and by fine-tuning the assembly process to
make rockets faster and cheaper than anyone else. This vision included the construction of a type of
mobile launch vehicle that could travel to various sites, take the rocket from a horizontal to vertical
position, and send it off to space—no muss, no fuss. SpaceX was meant to get so good at this process
that it could do multiple launches a month, make money off each one, and never need to become a
huge contractor dependent on government funds.
SpaceX was to be America’s attempt at a clean slate in the rocket business, a modernized reset.
Musk felt that the space industry had not really evolved in about fifty years. The aerospace companies
had little competition and tended to make supremely expensive products that achieved maximum
performance. They were building a Ferrari for every launch, when it was possible that a Honda
Accord might do the trick. Musk, by contrast, would apply some of the start-up techniques he’d
learned in Silicon Valley to run SpaceX lean and fast and capitalize on the huge advances in
computing power and materials that had taken place over the past couple of decades. As a private
company, SpaceX would also avoid the waste and cost overruns associated with government
contractors. Musk declared that SpaceX’s first rocket would be called the Falcon 1, a nod to Star
Wars’ Millennium Falcon and his role as the architect of an exciting future. At a time when the cost of
sending a 550-pound payload started at $30 million, he promised that the Falcon 1 would be able to
carry a 1,400-pound payload for $6.9 million.
Bowing to his nature, Musk set an insanely ambitious timeline for all of this. One of the earliest
SpaceX presentations suggested that the company would complete its first engine in May 2003, a
second engine in June, the body of the rocket in July, and have everything assembled in August. A
launchpad would then be prepared by September, and the first launch would take place in November
2003, or about fifteen months after the company started. A trip to Mars was naturally slated for
somewhere near the end of the decade. This was Musk the logical, naïve optimist tabulating how long
it should take people physically to perform all of this work. It’s the baseline he expects of himself and
one that his employees, with their human foibles, are in a never-ending struggle to match.
As space enthusiasts started to learn about the new company, they didn’t really obsess over
whether Musk’s delivery schedule sounded realistic or not. They were just thrilled that someone had
decided to take the cheap and fast approach. Some members of the military had already been
promoting the idea of giving the armed forces more aggressive space capabilities, or what they called
“responsive space.” If a conflict broke out, the military wanted the ability to respond with purposebuilt satellites for that mission. This would mean moving away from a model where it takes ten years
to build and deploy a satellite for a specific job. Instead, the military desired cheaper, smaller
satellites that could be reconfigured through software and sent up on short notice, almost like
disposable satellites. “If we could pull that off, it would be really game-changing,” said Pete Worden,
a retired air force general, who met with Musk while serving as a consultant to the Defense
Department. “It could make our response in space similar to what we do on land, sea and in the air.”
Worden’s job required him to look at radical technologies. While many of the people he encountered
came off as eccentric dreamers, Musk seemed grounded, knowledgeable, and capable. “I talked to
people building ray guns and things in their garages. It was clear that Elon was different. He was a
visionary who really understood the rocket technology, and I was impressed with him.”
Like the military, scientists wanted cheap, quick access to space and the ability to send upexperiments and get data back on a regular basis. Some companies in the medical and consumergoods industries were also interested in rides to space to study how a lack of gravity affected the
properties of their products.
As good as a cheap launch vehicle sounded, the odds of a private citizen building one that worked
were beyond remote. A quick search on YouTube for “rocket explosions” turns up thousands of
compilation videos documenting U.S. and Soviet launch disasters that have occurred over the
decades. From 1957 to 1966, the United States alone tried to blast more than 400 rockets into orbit
and about 100 of them crashed and burned.5 The rockets used to transport things to space are mostly
modified missiles developed through all of this trial and error and funded by billions upon billions of
government dollars. SpaceX had the advantage of being able to learn from this past work and having
a few people on staff that had overseen rocket projects at companies like Boeing and TRW. That said,
the start-up did not have a budget that could support a string of explosions. At best, SpaceX would
have three or four shots at making the Falcon 1 work. “People thought we were just crazy,” Mueller
said. “At TRW, I had an army of people and government funding. Now we were going to make a lowcost rocket from scratch with a small team. People just didn’t think it could be done.”
In July 2002, Musk was gripped by the excitement of this daring enterprise, and eBay made its
aggressive move to buy PayPal for $1.5 billion. This deal gave Musk some liquidity and supplied him
with more than $100 million to throw at SpaceX. With such a massive up-front investment, no one
would be able to wrestle control of SpaceX away from Musk as they had done at Zip2 and PayPal.
For the employees who had agreed to accompany Musk on this seemingly impossible journey, the
windfall provided at least a couple of years of job security. The acquisition also upped Musk’s
profile and celebrity, which he could leverage to score meetings with top government officials and to
sway suppliers.
And then all of a sudden none of this seemed to matter. Justine had given birth to a son—Nevada
Alexander Musk. He was ten weeks old when, just as the eBay deal was announced, he died. The
Musks had tucked Nevada in for a nap and placed the boy on his back as parents are taught to do.
When they returned to check on him, he was no longer breathing and had suffered from what the
doctors would term a sudden infant death syndrome–related incident. “By the time the paramedics
resuscitated him, he had been deprived of oxygen for so long that he was brain-dead,” Justine wrote
in her article for Marie Claire. “He spent three days on life support in a hospital in Orange County
before we made the decision to take him off it. I held him in my arms when he died. Elon made it
clear that he did not want to talk about Nevada’s death. I didn’t understand this, just as he didn’t
understand why I grieved openly, which he regarded as ‘emotionally manipulative.’ I buried my
feelings instead, coping with Nevada’s death by making my first visit to an IVF clinic less than two
months later. Elon and I planned to get pregnant again as swiftly as possible. Within the next five
years, I gave birth to twins, then triplets.” Later, Justine chalked up Musk’s reaction to a defense
mechanism that he’d learned from years of suffering as a kid. “He doesn’t do well in dark places,”
she told Esquire magazine. “He’s forward-moving, and I think it’s a survival thing with him.”
Musk did open up to a couple of close friends and expressed the depth of his misery. But for the
most part, Justine read her husband right. He didn’t see the value in grieving publicly. “It made me
extremely sad to talk about it,” Musk said. “I’m not sure why I’d want to talk about extremely sad
events. It does no good for the future. If you’ve got other kids and obligations, then wallowing in
sadness does no good for anyone around you. I’m not sure what should be done in such situations.”Following Nevada’s death, Musk threw himself at SpaceX and rapidly expanded the company’s
goals. His conversations with aerospace contractors around possible work for SpaceX left Musk
disenchanted. It sounded like they all charged a lot of money and worked slowly. The plan to integrate
components made by these types of companies gave way to the decision to make as much as practical
right at SpaceX. “While drawing upon the ideas of many prior launch vehicle programs from Apollo
to the X-34/Fastrac, SpaceX is privately developing the entire Falcon rocket from the ground up,
including both engines, the turbo-pump, the cryogenic tank structure and the guidance system,” the
company announced on its website. “A ground up internal development increases difficulty and the
required investment, but no other path will achieve the needed improvement in the cost of access to
space.”
The SpaceX executives Musk hired were an all-star crew. Mueller set to work right away
building the two engines—Merlin and Kestrel, named after two types of falcons. Chris Thompson, a
onetime marine who had managed the production of the Delta and Titan rockets at Boeing, joined as
the vice president of operations. Tim Buzza also came from Boeing, where he’d earned a reputation
as one of the world’s leading rocket testers. Steve Johnson, who had worked at JPL and at two
commercial space companies, was tapped as the senior mechanical engineer. The aerospace engineer
Hans Koenigsmann came on to develop the avionics, guidance, and control systems. Musk also
recruited Gwynne Shotwell, an aerospace veteran who started as SpaceX’s first salesperson and rose
in the years that followed to be president and Musk’s right-hand woman.
These early days also marked the arrival of Mary Beth Brown, a now-legendary character in the
lore of both SpaceX and Tesla. Brown—or MB, as everyone called her—became Musk’s loyal
assistant, establishing a real-life version of the relationship between Iron Man’s Tony Stark and
Pepper Potts. If Musk worked a twenty-hour day, so too did Brown. Over the years, she brought Musk
meals, set up his business appointments, arranged time with his children, picked out his clothes, dealt
with press requests, and when necessary yanked Musk out of meetings to keep him on schedule. She
would emerge as the only bridge between Musk and all of his interests and was an invaluable asset to
the companies’ employees.
Brown played a key role in developing SpaceX’s early culture. She paid attention to small details
like the office’s red spaceship trash cans and helped balance the vibe around the office. When it came
to matters related directly to Musk, Brown put on her firm countenance and no-nonsense attitude. The
rest of the time she usually had a warm, broad smile and a disarming charm. “It was always, ‘Oh,
dear. How are you, dear?’” recalled a SpaceX technician. Brown collected the weird e-mails that
arrived for Musk and sent them out as “Kook of the Week” missives to make people laugh. One of the
better entries included a pencil sketch of a lunar spacecraft that had a red spot on the page. The
person who sent in the letter had circled the spot on his own drawing and then written “What is that?
Blood?” next to it. In other letters there were plans for a perpetual motion machine and a proposal for
a giant inflatable rabbit that could be used to plug oil spills. For a short time, Brown’s duties
extended to managing SpaceX’s books and handling the flow of business in Musk’s absence. “She
pretty much called the shots,” the technician said. “She would say, ‘This is what Elon would want.’”
Her greatest gift, though, may have been reading Musk’s moods. At both SpaceX and Tesla,
Brown placed her desk a few feet in front of Musk’s, so that people had to pass her before having a
meeting with him. If someone needed to request permission to buy a big-ticket item, they would stop
for a moment in front of Brown and wait for a nod to go see Musk or the shake-off to go awaybecause Musk was having a bad day. This system of nods and shakes became particularly important
during periods of romantic strife for Musk, when his nerves were on edge more than usual.
The rank-and-file engineers at SpaceX tended to be young, male overachievers. Musk would
personally reach out to the aerospace departments of top colleges and inquire about the students who
had finished with the best marks on their exams. It was not unusual for him to call the students in their
dorm rooms and recruit them over the phone. “I thought it was a prank call,” said Michael Colonno,
who heard from Musk while attending Stanford. “I did not believe for a minute that he had a rocket
company.” Once the students looked Musk up on the Internet, selling them on SpaceX was easy. For
the first time in years if not decades, young aeronautics whizzes who pined to explore space had a
really exciting company to latch on to and a path toward designing a rocket or even becoming an
astronaut that did not require them to join a bureaucratic government contractor. As word of SpaceX’s
ambitions spread, top engineers from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital Sciences with a high
tolerance for risk fled to the upstart, too.
Throughout the first year at SpaceX, one or two new employees joined almost every week. Kevin
Brogan was employee No. 23 and came from TRW, where he’d been used to various internal policies
blocking him from doing work. “I called it the country club,” he said. “Nobody did anything.” Brogan
started at SpaceX the day after his interview and was told to go hunting in the office for a computer to
use. “It was go to Fry’s and get whatever you need and go to Staples and get a chair,” Brogan said. He
immediately felt in over his head and would work for twelve hours, drive home, sleep for ten hours,
and then head right back to the factory. “I was exhausted and out of shape mentally,” he said. “But
soon I loved it and got totally hooked.”
One of the first projects SpaceX decided to tackle was the construction of a gas generator, a
machine not unlike a small rocket engine that produces hot gas. Mueller, Buzza, and a couple of young
engineers assembled the generator in Los Angeles and then packed it into the back of a pickup truck
and drove it out to Mojave, California, to test it. A desert town about one hundred miles from Los
Angeles, Mojave had become a hub for aerospace companies like Scaled Composites and XCOR. A
lot of the aerospace projects were based out of the Mojave airport, where companies had their
workshops and sent up all manner of cutting-edge airplanes and rockets. The SpaceX team fit right
into this environment and borrowed a test stand from XCOR that was just about the perfect size to
hold the gas generator. The first ignition run took place at 11 A.M. and lasted ninety seconds. The gas
generator worked, but it had let out a billowing black smoke cloud that on this windless day parked
right over the airport tower. The airport manager came down to the test area and lit into Mueller and
Buzza. The airport official and some of the guys from XCOR who had been helping out urged the
SpaceX engineers to take it easy and wait until the next day to run another test. Instead, Buzza a strong
leader ready to put SpaceX’s relentless ethos into play, coordinated a couple of trucks to pick up
more fuel, talked the airport manager down, and got the test stand ready for another fire. In the days
that followed, SpaceX’s engineers perfected a routine that let them do multiple tests a day—an
unheard-of practice at the airport—and had the gas generator tuned to their liking after two weeks of
work.
They made a few more trips to Mojave and some other spots, including a test stand at Edwards
Air Force Base and another in Mississippi. While on this countrywide rocketry tour, the SpaceX
engineers came across a three-hundred-acre test site in McGregor, Texas, a small city near the center
of the state. They really liked this spot, and talked Musk into buying it. The navy had tested rockets onthe land years before and so too had Andrew Beal before his aerospace company collapsed. “After
Beal saw it was going to cost him $300 million to develop a rocket capable of sending sizeable
satellites into orbit, he called it quits, leaving behind a lot of useful infrastructure for SpaceX,
including a three-story concrete tripod with legs as big around as redwood tree trunks,” wrote
journalist Michael Belfiore in Rocketeers, a book that captured the rise of a handful of private space
companies.
Jeremy Hollman was one of the young engineers who soon found himself living in Texas and
customizing the test site to SpaceX’s needs. Hollman exemplified the kind of recruit Musk wanted:
he’d earned an aerospace engineering degree from Iowa State University and a master’s in
astronautical engineering from the University of Southern California. He’d spent a couple of years
working as a test engineer at Boeing dealing with jets, rockets, and spacecraft.*
The stint at Boeing had left Hollman unimpressed with big aerospace. His first day on the job
came right as Boeing completed its merger with McDonnell Douglas. The resultant mammoth
government contractor held a picnic to boost morale but ended up failing at even this simple exercise.
“The head of one of the departments gave a speech about it being one company with one vision and
then added that the company was very cost constrained,” Hollman said. “He asked that everyone limit
themselves to one piece of chicken.” Things didn’t improve much from there. Every project at Boeing
felt large, cumbersome, and costly. So, when Musk came along selling radical change, Hollman bit. “I
thought it was an opportunity I could not pass up,” he said. At twenty-three, Hollman was young,
single, and willing to give up any semblance of having a life in favor of working at SpaceX nonstop,
and he became Mueller’s second in command.
Mueller had developed a pair of three-dimensional computer models of the two engines he
wanted to build. Merlin would be the engine for the first stage of the Falcon 1, which lifted it off the
ground, and Kestrel would be the smaller engine used to power the upper, second stage of the rocket
and guide it in space. Together, Hollman and Mueller figured out which parts of the engines SpaceX
would build at the factory and which parts it would try to buy. For the purchased parts, Hollman had
to head out to various machine shops and get quotes and delivery dates for the hardware. Quite often,
the machinists told Hollman that SpaceX’s timelines were nuts. Others were more accommodating
and would try to bend an existing product to SpaceX’s needs instead of building something from
scratch. Hollman also found that creativity got him a long way. He discovered, for example, that
changing the seals on some readily available car wash valves made them good enough to be used with
rocket fuel.
After SpaceX completed its first engine at the factory in California, Hollman loaded it and
mounds of other equipment into a U-Haul trailer. He hitched the U-Haul to the back of a white
Hummer H2 and drove four thousand pounds of gear* across Interstate 10 from Los Angeles to Texas
and the test site. The arrival of the engine in Texas kicked off one of the great bonding exercises in
SpaceX’s history. Amid rattlesnakes, fire ants, isolation, and searing heat, the group led by Buzza and
Mueller began the process of exploring every intricacy of the engines. It was a high-pressure slog full
of explosions—or what the engineers politely called “rapid unscheduled disassemblies”—that would
determine whether a small band of engineers really could match the effort and skill of nation-states.
The SpaceX employees christened the site in fitting fashion, downing a $1,200 bottle of Rémy Martin
cognac out of paper cups and passing a sobriety test on the drive back to the company apartments in
the Hummer. From that point on, the trek from California to the test site became known as the TexasCattle Haul. The SpaceX engineers would work for ten days straight, come back to California for a
weekend, and then head back. To ease the burden of travel, Musk sometimes let them use his private
jet. “It carried six people,” Mueller said. “Well, seven if someone sat in the toilet, which happened
all the time.”
While the navy and Beal had left some testing apparatus, SpaceX had to build a large amount of
custom gear. One of the largest of these structures was a horizontal test stand about 30 feet long, 15
feet wide, and 15 feet tall. Then there was the complementary vertical test stand that stood two stories
high. When an engine needed to be fired, it would be fastened to one of the test stands, outfitted with
sensors to collect data, and monitored via several cameras. The engineers took shelter in a bunker
protected on one side by a dirt embankment. If something went wrong, they would look at feeds from
the webcams or slowly lift one of the bunker’s hatches to listen for any clues. The locals in town
rarely complained about the noise, although the animals on nearby farms seemed less impressed.
“Cows have this natural defense mechanism where they gather and start running in a circle,” Hollman
said. “Every time we fired an engine, the cows scattered and then got in that circle with the younger
ones placed in the middle. We set up a cow cam to watch them.”
Both Kestrel and Merlin came with challenges, and they were treated as alternating engineering
exercises. “We would run Merlin until we ran out of hardware or did something bad,” Mueller said.
“Then we’d run Kestrel and there was never a shortage of things to do.” For months, the SpaceX
engineers arrived at the site at 8 A.M. and spent twelve hours there working on the engines before
retiring to the Outback Steakhouse for dinner. Mueller had a particular knack for looking over test
data and spotting some place where the engine ran hot or cold or had another flaw. He would call
California and prescribe hardware changes, and engineers would refashion parts and send them off to
Texas. Often the workers in Texas modified parts themselves using a mill and lathe that Mueller had
brought out. “Kestrel started out as a real dog, and one of my proudest moments was taking it from
terrible to great performance with stuff we bought online and did in the machine shop,” Mueller said.
Some members of the Texas crew honed their skills to the point that they could build a test-worthy
engine in three days. These same people were required to be adept at software. They’d pull an allnighter building a turbo pump for the engine and then dig in the next night to retool a suite of
applications used to control the engines. Hollman did this type of work all the time and was an allstar, but he was not alone among this group of young, nimble engineers who crossed disciplines out of
necessity and the spirit of adventure. “There was an almost addictive quality to the experience,”
Hollman said. “You’re twenty-four or twenty-five, and they’re trusting you with so much. It was very
empowering.”
To get to space, the Merlin engine would need to burn for 180 seconds. That seemed like an
eternity for the engineers at the outset of their stint in Texas, when the engine would burn for only a
half second before it conked out. Sometimes Merlin vibrated too much during the tests. Sometimes it
responded badly to a new material. Sometimes it cracked and needed major part upgrades, like
moving from an aluminum manifold to a manifold made out of the more exotic Inconel, an alloy suited
to extreme temperatures. On one occasion, a fuel valve refused to open properly and caused the
whole engine to blow up. Another test gone wrong ended up with the whole test stand burning down.
It usually came to Buzza and Mueller to make the unpleasant call back to Musk and recap the day’s
foibles. “Elon had pretty good patience,” Mueller said. “I remember one time we had two test stands
running and blew up two things in one day. I told Elon we could put another engine on there, but I wasreally, really frustrated and just tired and mad and was kinda short with Elon. I said, ‘We can put
another fucking thing on there, but I’ve blown up enough shit today.’ He said, ‘Okay, all right, that’s
fine. Just calm down. We’ll do it again tomorrow.’” Coworkers in El Segundo later reported that
Musk had been near tears during this call after hearing the frustration and agony in Mueller’s voice.
What Musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan of attack. Hollman was
one of many engineers who arrived at this realization after facing one of Musk’s trademark grillings.
“The worst call was the first one,” Hollman said. “Something had gone wrong, and Elon asked me
how long it would take to be operational again, and I didn’t have an immediate answer. He said, ‘You
need to. This is important to the company. Everything is riding on this. Why don’t you have an
answer?’ He kept hitting me with pointed, direct questions. I thought it was more important to let him
know quickly what happened, but I learned it was more important to have all the information.”
From time to time, Musk participated in the testing process firsthand. One of the more memorable
examples of this came as SpaceX tried to perfect a cooling chamber for its engines. The company had
bought several of these chambers at $75,000 a pop and needed to put them under pressure with water
to gauge their ability to handle stress. During the initial test, one of the pricey chambers cracked. Then
the second one broke in the same place. Musk ordered a third test, as the engineers looked on in
horror. They thought the test might be putting the chamber under undue stress and that Musk was
burning through essential equipment. When the third chamber cracked, Musk flew the hardware back
to California, took it to the factory floor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the
chambers with an epoxy to see if it would seal them. “He’s not afraid to get his hands dirty,” Mueller
said. “He’s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes and has epoxy all over him. They were
there all night and tested it again and it broke anyway.” Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the
hardware was flawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly, asking the engineers to come up
with a new solution.
These incidents were all part of a trying but productive process. SpaceX had developed the
feeling of a small, tight-knit family up against the world. In late 2002, the company had an empty
warehouse. One year later, the facility looked like a real rocket factory. Working Merlin engines were
arriving back from Texas, and being fed into an assembly line where machinists could connect them to
the main body, or first stage, of the rocket. More stations were set up to link the first stage with the
upper stage of the rocket. Cranes were placed on the floor to handle the heavy lifting of components,
and blue metal transport tracks were positioned to guide the rocket’s body through the factory from
station to station. SpaceX had also started to build the fairing, or case, that protects payloads atop the
rocket during launch and then opens up like a clam in space to let out the cargo.
SpaceX had picked up a customer as well. According to Musk, its first rocket would launch in
“early 2004” from Vandenberg Air Force Base, carrying a satellite called TacSat-1 for the
Department of Defense. With this goal looming, twelve-hour days, six days a week were considered
the norm, although many people worked longer than that for extended periods of time. Respites, as far
as they existed, came around 8 P.M. on some weeknights when Musk would allow everyone to use
their work computers to play first-person-shooter video games like Quake III Arena and CounterStrike against each other. At the appointed hour, the sound of guns loading would cascade throughout
the office as close to twenty people armed themselves for battle. Musk—playing under the handle
Random9—often won the games, talking trash and blasting away his employees without mercy. “The
CEO is there shooting at us with rockets and plasma guns,” said Colonno. “Worse, he’s almostalarmingly good at these games and has insanely fast reactions. He knew all the tricks and how to
sneak up on people.”
The pending launch ignited Musk’s salesman instincts. He wanted to show the public what his
tireless workers had accomplished and drum up some excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to
unveil a prototype of Falcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the sevenstory-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it—and the SpaceX mobile
launch system—outside of the Federal Aviation Administration’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.
An accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a modern, smarter,
cheaper rocket maker had arrived.
This marketing song and dance didn’t sound sensible to SpaceX’s engineers. They were working
more than one hundred hours per week to make the actual rocket that SpaceX would need to be in
business. Musk wanted them to do that and build a slick-looking mock-up. Engineers were called
back from Texas and assigned another ulcer-inducing deadline to craft this prop. “In my mind, it was
a boondoggle,” Hollman said. “It wasn’t advancing anything. In Elon’s mind, it would get us a lot of
backing from important people in the government.”
While making the prototype for the event, Hollman experienced the full spectrum of highs and
lows that came with working for Musk. The engineer had lost his regular glasses weeks earlier when
they slipped off his face and fell down a flame duct at the Texas test site. Hollman had since made do
by wearing an old pair of prescription safety glasses,* but they too were ruined when he scratched the
lenses while trying to duck under an engine at the SpaceX factory. Without a spare moment to visit an
optometrist, Hollman started to feel his sanity fray. The long hours, the scratch, the publicity stunt—
they were all too much.
He vented about this in the factory one night, unaware that Musk stood nearby and could hear
everything. Two hours later, Mary Beth Brown appeared with an appointment card to see a Lasik eye
surgery specialist. When Hollman visited the doctor, he discovered that Musk had already agreed to
pay for the surgery. “Elon can be very demanding, but he’ll make sure the obstacles in your way are
removed,” Hollman said. Upon reflection, he also warmed to the long-term thinking behind Musk’s
Washington plan. “I think he wanted to add an element of realism to SpaceX, and if you park a rocket
in someone’s front yard, it’s hard to deny it,” Hollman said.
The event in Washington ended up being well received, and just a few weeks after it took place,
SpaceX made another astonishing announcement. Despite not having even flown a rocket yet, SpaceX
revealed plans for a second rocket. Along with the Falcon 1, it would build the Falcon 5. Per the
name, this rocket would have five engines and could carry more weight—9,200 pounds—to low orbit
around Earth. Crucially, the Falcon 5 could also theoretically reach the International Space Station for
resupply missions—a capability that would open up SpaceX for some large NASA contracts. And, in
a nod to Musk’s obsession with safety, the rocket was said to be able to complete its missions even if
three of the five engines failed, which was a level of added reliability that had not been seen in the
market in decades.
The only way to keep up with all of this work was to do what SpaceX had promised from the
beginning: operate in the spirit of a Silicon Valley start-up. Musk was always looking for brainy
engineers who had not just done well at school but had done something exceptional with their talents.
When he found someone good, Musk was relentless in courting him or her to come to SpaceX. Bryan
Gardner, for example, first met Musk at a space rave in the hangars at the Mojave airport and a shortwhile later started talking about a job. Gardner was having some of his academic work sponsored by
Northrop Grumman. “Elon said, ‘We’ll buy them out,’” Gardner said. “So, I e-mailed him my resume
at two thirty A.M., and he replied back in thirty minutes addressing everything I put in there point by
point. He said, ‘When you interview make sure you can talk concretely about what you do rather than
use buzzwords.’ It floored me that he would take the time to do this.” After being hired, Gardner was
tasked with improving the system for testing the valves on the Merlin engine. There were dozens of
valves, and it took three to five hours to manually test each one. Six months later, Gardner had built an
automated system for testing the valves in minutes. The testing machine tracked the valves
individually, so that an engineer in Texas could request what the metrics had been on a specific part.
“I had been handed this redheaded stepchild that no one else wanted to deal with and established my
engineering credibility,” Gardner said.
As the new hires arrived, SpaceX moved beyond its original building to fill up several buildings
in the El Segundo complex. The engineers were running demanding software and rendering large
graphics files and needed high-speed connections between all of these offices. But SpaceX had
neighbors who were blocking an initiative to connect all of its buildings via fiber optic lines. Instead
of taking the time to haggle with the other companies for right of way, the IT chief Branden Spikes,
who had worked with Musk at Zip2 and PayPal, came up with a quicker, more devious solution. A
friend of his worked for the phone company and drew a diagram that demonstrated a way to squeeze a
networking cable safely between the electricity, cable, and phone wires on a telephone pole. At 2
A.M., an off-the-books crew showed up with a cherry picker and ran fiber to the telephone poles and
then ran cables straight to the SpaceX buildings. “We did that over a weekend instead of taking
months to get permits,” Spikes said. “There was always this feeling that we were facing a sort of
insurmountable challenge and that we had to band together to fight the good fight.” SpaceX’s landlord,
Alex Lidow, chuckled when thinking back to all of the antics of Musk’s team. “I know they did a lot of
hanky stuff at night,” he said. “They were smart, needed to get things done, and didn’t always have
time to wait for things like city permits.”
Musk never relented in asking his employees to do more and be better, whether it was at the office
or during extracurricular activities. Part of Spikes’s duties included building custom gaming PCs for
Musk’s home that pushed their computational power to the limits and needed to be cooled with water
running through a series of tubes inside the machines. When one of these gaming rigs kept breaking,
Spikes figured out that Musk’s mansion had dirty power lines and had a second, dedicated power
circuit built for the gaming room to correct the problem. Doing this favor bought Spikes no special
treatment. “SpaceX’s mail server crashed one time, and Elon word for word said, ‘Don’t ever
fucking let that happen again,’” Spikes said. “He had a way of looking at you—a glare—and would
keep looking at you until you understood him.”
Musk had tried to find contractors that could keep up with SpaceX’s creativity and pace. Instead
of always hitting up aerospace guys, for example, he located suppliers with similar experience from
different fields. Early on, SpaceX needed someone to build the fuel tanks, essentially the main body
of the rocket, and Musk ended up in the Midwest talking to companies that had made large, metal
agricultural tanks used in the dairy and food processing businesses. These suppliers also struggled to
keep up with SpaceX’s schedule, and Musk found himself flying across the country to pay visits—
sometimes surprise ones—on the contractors to check on their progress. One such inspection took
place at a company in Wisconsin called Spincraft. Musk and a couple of SpaceX employees flew hisjet across the country and arrived late at night expecting to see a shift of workers doing extra duty to
get the fuel tanks completed. When Musk discovered that Spincraft was well behind schedule, he
turned to a Spincraft employee and informed him, “You’re fucking us up the ass, and it doesn’t feel
good.” David Schmitz was a general manager at Spincraft and said Musk earned a reputation as a
fearsome negotiator who did indeed follow up on things personally. “If Elon was not happy, you knew
it,” Schmitz said. “Things could get nasty.” In the months that followed that meeting, SpaceX
increased its internal welding capabilities so that it could make the fuel tanks in El Segundo and ditch
Spincraft.
Another salesman flew down to SpaceX to sell the company on some technology infrastructure
equipment. He was doing the standard relationship-building exercise practiced by salespeople for
centuries. Show up. Speak for a while. Feel each other out. Then, start doing business down the road.
Musk was having none of it. “The guy comes in, and Elon asks him why they’re meeting,” Spikes
said. “He said, ‘To develop a relationship.’ Elon replied, ‘Okay. Nice to meet you,’ which basically
meant, ‘Get the fuck out of my office.’ This guy had spent four hours traveling for what ended up as a
two-minute meeting. Elon just has no tolerance for that kind of stuff.” Musk could be equally brisk
with employees who were not hitting his standards. “He would often say, ‘The longer you wait to fire
someone the longer it has been since you should have fired them,’” Spikes said.
Most of the SpaceX employees were thrilled to be part of the company’s adventure and tried not
to let Musk’s grueling demands and harsh behavior get to them. But there were some moments where
Musk went too far. The engineering corps flew into a collective rage every time they caught Musk in
the press claiming to have designed the Falcon rocket more or less by himself. Musk also hired a
documentary crew to follow him around for a while. This audacious gesture really grated on the
people toiling away in the SpaceX factory. They felt like Musk’s ego had gotten the best of him and
that he was presenting SpaceX as the conqueror of the aerospace industry when the company had yet
to launch successfully. Employees who made detailed cases around what they saw as flaws in the
Falcon 5 design or presented practical suggestions to get the Falcon 1 out the door more quickly were
often ignored or worse. “The treatment of staff was not good for long stretches of this era,” said one
engineer. “Many good engineers, who everyone beside ‘management’ felt were assets to the company,
were forced out or simply fired outright after being blamed for things they hadn’t done. The kiss of
death was proving Elon wrong about something.”
Early 2004, when SpaceX had hoped to launch its rocket, came and went. The Merlin engine that
Mueller and his team had built appeared to be among the most efficient rocket engines ever made. It
was just taking longer than Musk had expected to pass tests needed to clear the engine for a launch.
Finally, in the fall of 2004, the engines were burning consistently and meeting all their requirements.
This meant that Mueller and his team could breathe easy and that everyone else at SpaceX should
prepare to suffer. Mueller had spent SpaceX’s entire existence as the “critical path”—the person
holding up the company from achieving its next steps—working under Musk’s scrutiny. “With the
engine ready, it was time for mass panic,” Mueller said. “No one else knew what it was like to be on
critical path.”
Lots of people soon found out, as major problems abounded. The avionics, which included the
electronics for the navigation, communication, and overall management of the rocket, turned into a
nightmare. Seemingly trivial things like getting a flash storage drive to talk to the rocket’s main
computer failed for undetectable reasons. The software needed to manage the rocket also became amajor burden. “It’s like anything else where you find out that the last ten percent is where all the
integration happens and things don’t play together,” Mueller said. “This process went on for six
months.” Finally, in May 2005, SpaceX transported the rocket 180 miles north to Vandenberg Air
Force Base for a test fire and completed a five-second burn on the launchpad.
Launching from Vandenberg would have been very convenient for SpaceX. The site is close to
Los Angeles and has several launchpads to pick from. SpaceX, though, became an unwelcome guest.
The air force gave the newcomer a cool welcome, and the people assigned to manage the launch sites
did not go out of their way help SpaceX. Lockheed and Boeing, which fly $1 billion spy satellites for
the military from Vandenberg, didn’t care for SpaceX’s presence, either—in part because SpaceX
represented a threat to their business and in part because this startup was mucking around near their
precious cargo. As SpaceX started to move from the testing phase to the launch, it was told to get in
line. They would have to wait months to launch. “Even though they said we could fly, it was clear that
we would not,” said Gwynne Shotwell.
Searching for a new site, Shotwell and Hans Koenigsmann put a Mercator projection of the world
up on the wall and looked for a name they recognized along the equator, where the planet spins faster
and gives rockets an added boost. The first name that jumped out was Kwajalein Island—or Kwaj—
the largest island in an atoll between Guam and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean and part of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands. This spot registered with Shotwell because the U.S. Army had used it for
decades as a missile test site. Shotwell looked up the name of a colonel at the test site and sent him an
e-mail, and three weeks later got a call back with the army saying they would love to have SpaceX fly
from the islands. In June 2005, SpaceX’s engineers began to fill containers with their equipment to
ship them to Kwaj.
About one hundred islands make up the Kwajalein Atoll. Many of them stretch for just a few
hundred yards and are much longer than they are wide. “From the air, the place looks like these
beautiful beads on a string,” said Pete Worden, who visited the site in his capacity as a Defense
Department consultant. Most of the people in the area live on an island called Ebeye, while the U.S.
military has taken over Kwajalein, the southernmost island, and turned it into part tropical paradise
and part Dr. Evil’s secret lair. The United States spent years lobbing its ICBMs from California at
Kwaj and used the island to run experiments on its space weapons during the “Star Wars” period.
Laser beams would be aimed at Kwaj from space in a bid to see if they were accurate and responsive
enough to take out an ICBM hurtling toward the islands. The military presence resulted in a weird
array of buildings including hulking, windowless trapezoidal concrete structures clearly conceived by
someone who deals with death for a living.
To get to Kwaj, the SpaceX employees either flew on Musk’s jet or took commercial flights
through Hawaii. The main accommodations were two-bedroom affairs on Kwajalein Island that
looked more like dormitories than hotel rooms, with their military-issued dressers and desks. Any
materials that the engineers needed had to be flown in on Musk’s plane or were more often brought by
boat from Hawaii or the mainland United States. Each day, the SpaceX crew gathered their gear and
took a forty-five-minute boat ride to Omelek, a seven-acre, palm-tree-and vegetation-covered island
that would be transformed into their launchpad. Over the course of several months, a small team of
people cleared the brush, poured concrete to support the launchpad, and converted a double-wide
trailer into offices. The work was grueling and took place in soul-sapping humidity under a sun
powerful enough to burn the skin through a T-shirt. Eventually, some of the workers preferred tospend the night on Omelek rather than make the journey through rough waters back to the main island.
“Some of the offices were turned into bedrooms with mattresses and cots,” Hollman said. “Then we
shipped over a very nice refrigerator and a good grill and plumbed in a shower. We tried to make it
less like camping and more like living.”
The sun rose at 7 A.M. each day, and that’s when the SpaceX team got to work. A series of
meetings would take place with people listing what needed to get done, and debating solutions to
lingering problems. As the large structures arrived, the workers placed the body of the rocket
horizontally in a makeshift hangar and spent hours melding together all of its parts. “There was
always something to do,” Hollman said. “If the engine wasn’t a problem, then there was an avionics
problem or a software problem.” By 7 P.M., the engineers wound down their work. “One or two
people would decide it was their night to cook, and they would make steak and potatoes and pasta,”
Hollman said. “We had a bunch of movies and a DVD player, and some of us did a lot of fishing off
the docks.” For many of the engineers, this was both a torturous and magical experience. “At Boeing
you could be comfortable, but that wasn’t going to happen at SpaceX,” said Walter Sims, a SpaceX
tech expert who found time to get certified to dive while on Kwaj. “Every person on that island was a
fucking star, and they were always holding seminars on radios or the engine. It was such an
invigorating place.”
The engineers were constantly baffled by what Musk would fund and what he wouldn’t. Back at
headquarters, someone would ask to buy a $200,000 machine or a pricey part that they deemed
essential to Falcon 1’s success, and Musk would deny the request. And yet he was totally comfortable
paying a similar amount to put a shiny surface on the factory floor to make it look nice. On Omelek,
the workers wanted to pave a two-hundred-yard pathway between the hangar and the launchpad to
make it easier to transport the rocket. Musk refused. This left the engineers moving the rocket and its
wheeled support structure in the fashion of the ancient Egyptians. They laid down a series of wooden
planks and rolled the rocket across them, grabbing the last piece of wood from the back and running it
forward in a continuous cycle.
The whole situation was ludicrous. A start-up rocket company had ended up in the middle of
nowhere trying to pull off one of the most difficult feats known to man, and, truth be told, only a
handful of the SpaceX team had any idea how to make a launch happen. Time and again, the rocket
would get marched out to the launchpad and hoisted vertical for a couple of days, while technical and
safety checks would reveal a litany of new problems. The engineers worked on the rocket for as long
as they could before laying it horizontal and marching it back to the hangar to avoid damage from the
salty air. Teams that had worked separately for months back at the SpaceX factory—propulsion,
avionics, software—were thrust together on the island and forced to become an interdisciplinary
whole. The sum total was an extreme learning and bonding exercise that played like a comedy of
errors. “It was like Gilligan’s Island except with rockets,” Hollman said.
In November 2005, about six months after they had first gotten to the island, the SpaceX team felt
ready to give launching a shot. Musk flew in with his brother, Kimbal, and joined the majority of the
SpaceX team in the barracks on Kwaj. On November 26, a handful of people woke up at 3 A.M. and
filled the rocket with liquid oxygen. They then scampered off to an island about three miles away for
protection, while the rest of the SpaceX team monitored the launch systems from a control room
twenty-six miles away on Kwaj. The military gave SpaceX a six-hour launch window. Everyone was
hoping to see the first stage take off and reach about 6,850 miles per hour before giving way to thesecond stage, which would ignite up in the air and reach 17,000 miles per hour. But, while going
through the pre-launch checks, the engineers detected a major problem: a valve on a liquid oxygen
tank would not close, and the LOX was boiling off into the air at 500 gallons per hour. SpaceX
scrambled to fix the issue but lost too much of its fuel to launch before the window closed.
With that mission aborted, SpaceX ordered major LOX reinforcements from Hawaii and prepared
for another attempt in mid-December. High winds, faulty valves, and other errors thwarted that launch
attempt. Before another attempt could be made, SpaceX discovered on a Saturday night that the
rocket’s power distribution systems had started malfunctioning and would need new capacitors. On
Sunday morning, the rocket was lowered and split into its two stages so that a technician could slide
in and remove the electrical boards. Someone found an electronics supplier that was open on Sunday
in Minnesota, and off a SpaceX employee flew to get some fresh capacitors. By Monday he was in
California and testing the parts at SpaceX’s headquarters to make sure they passed various heat and
vibration checks, then on a plane again back to the islands. In under eighty hours, the electronics had
been returned in working order and installed in the rocket. The dash to the United States and back
showed that SpaceX’s thirty-person team had real pluck in the face of adversity and inspired
everyone on the island. A traditional three-hundred-person-strong aerospace launch crew would
never have tried to fix a rocket like that on the fly. But the energy, smarts, and resourcefulness of the
SpaceX team still could not overcome their inexperience or the difficult conditions. More problems
arose and blocked any thoughts of a launch.
Finally, on March 24, 2006, it was all systems go. The Falcon 1 stood on its square launchpad
and ignited. It soared into the sky, turning the island below it into a green spec amid a vast, blue
expanse. In the control room, Musk paced as he watched the action, wearing shorts, flip-flops, and a
T-shirt. Then, about twenty-five seconds in, it became clear that all was not well. A fire broke out
above the Merlin engine and suddenly this machine that had been flying straight and true started to
spin and then tumble uncontrollably back to Earth. The Falcon 1 ended up falling directly down onto
the launch site. Most of the debris went into a reef 250 feet from the launchpad, and the satellite cargo
smashed through SpaceX’s machine shop roof and landed more or less intact on the floor. Some of the
engineers put on their snorkeling and scuba gear and recovered the pieces, fitting all of the rocket’s
remnants into two refrigerator-sized crates. “It is perhaps worth noting that those launch companies
that succeeded also took their lumps along the way,” Musk wrote in a postmortem. “A friend of mine
wrote to remind me that only 5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches succeeded; 3 of 5 for Ariane; 9 of 20
for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz; and 9 of 18 for Proton. Having experienced firsthand how hard it is to
reach orbit, I have a lot of respect for those that persevered to produce the vehicles that are mainstays
of space launch today.” Musk closed the letter writing, “SpaceX is in this for the long haul and, come
hell or high water, we are going to make this work.”
Musk and other SpaceX executives blamed the crash on an unnamed technician. They said this
technician had done some work on the rocket one day before the launch and failed to properly tighten
a fitting on a fuel pipe, which caused the fitting to crack. The fitting in question was something basic
—an aluminum b-nut that’s often used to connect a pair of tubes. The technician was Hollman. In the
aftermath of the rocket crash, Hollman flew to Los Angeles to confront Musk directly. He’d spent
years working day and night on the Falcon 1 and felt enraged that Musk had called out him and his
team in public. Hollman knew that he’d fastened the b-nut correctly and that observers from NASA
had been looking over his shoulder to check the work. When Hollman charged into SpaceX’sheadquarters with a head full of fury, Mary Beth Brown tried to calm him and stop him from seeing
Musk. Hollman kept going anyway, and the two of them proceeded to have a shouting match at Musk’s
cubicle.
After all the debris was analyzed, it turned out that the b-nut had almost certainly cracked due to
corrosion from the months in Kwaj’s salty atmosphere. “The rocket was literally crusted with salt on
one side, and you had to scrape it off,” Mueller said. “But we had done a static fire three days earlier,
and everything was fine.” SpaceX had tried to save about fifty pounds of weight by using aluminum
components instead of stainless steel. Thompson, the former marine, had seen the aluminum parts
work just fine in helicopters that sat on aircraft carriers, and Mueller had seen aircraft resting outside
of Cape Canaveral for forty years with aluminum b-nuts in fine condition. Years later, a number of
SpaceX’s executives still agonize over the way Hollman and his team were treated. “They were our
best guys, and they kind of got blamed to get an answer out to the world,” Mueller said. “That was
really bad. We found out later that it was dumb luck.”*
After the crash, there was a lot of drinking at a bar on the main island. Musk wanted to launch
again within six months, but putting together a new machine would again require an immense amount
of work. SpaceX had some pieces for the vehicle ready in El Segundo but certainly not a ready-tofire rocket. As they downed drinks, the engineers vowed to take a more disciplined approach with
their next craft and to work better as a collective. Worden hoped the SpaceX engineers would raise
their game as well. He’d been observing them for the Defense Department and loved the energy of the
young engineers but not their methodology. “It was being done like a bunch of kids in Silicon Valley
would do software,” Worden said. “They would stay up all night and try this and try that. I’d seen
hundreds of these types of operations, and it struck me that it wouldn’t work.” Leading up to the first
launch, Worden tried to caution Musk, sending a letter to him and the director of DARPA, the research
arm of the Defense Department, that made his views clear. “Elon didn’t react well. He said, ‘What do
you know? You’re just an astronomer,’” Worden said. But, after the rocket blew up, Musk
recommended that Worden perform an investigation for the government. “I give Elon huge credit for
that,” Worden said.
Almost exactly a year later, SpaceX was ready to try another launch. On March 15, 2007, a
successful test fire took place. Then, on March 21, the Falcon 1 finally behaved. From its launchpad
surrounded by palm trees, the Falcon 1 surged up and toward space. It flew for a couple of minutes
with engineers now and again reporting that the systems were “nominal,” or in good shape. At three
minutes into the flight, the first stage of the rocket separated and fell back to Earth, and the Kestrel
engine kicked in as planned to carry the second stage into orbit. Ecstatic cheers went out in the
control room. Next, at the four-minute mark, the fairing atop the rocket separated as planned. “It was
doing exactly what it was supposed to do,” said Mueller. “I was sitting next to Elon and looked at him
and said, ‘We’ve made it.’ We’re hugging and believe it’s going to make it to orbit. Then, it starts to
wiggle.” For more than five glorious minutes, the SpaceX engineers got to feel like they had done
everything right. A camera on board the Falcon 1 pointed down and showed Earth getting smaller and
smaller as the rocket made its way methodically into space. But then that wiggle that Mueller noticed
turned into flailing, and the machine swooned, started to break apart, and then blew up. This time the
SpaceX engineers were quick to figure out what went wrong. As the propellant was consumed, what
was left started to move around the tank and slosh against the sides, much like wine spinning around a
glass. The sloshing propellant triggered the wobbling, and at one point it sloshed enough to leave anopening to the engine exposed. When the engine sucked in a big breath of air, it flamed out.
The failure was another crushing blow to SpaceX’s engineers. Some of them had spent close to
two years shuffling back and forth between California, Hawaii, and Kwaj. By the time SpaceX could
attempt another launch, it would be about four years after Musk’s original target, and the company had
been chewing through his Internet fortune at a worrying rate. Musk had vowed publicly that he would
see this thing through to the end, but people inside and outside the company were doing back-of-theenvelope math and could tell that SpaceX likely could only afford one more attempt—maybe two. To
the extent that the financial situation unnerved Musk, he rarely if ever let it show to employees. “Elon
did a great job of not burdening people with those worries,” said Spikes. “He always communicated
the importance of being lean and of success, but it was never ‘if we fail, we’re done for.’ He was
very optimistic.”
The failures seemed to do little to curtail Musk’s vision for the future or raise doubts about his
capabilities. In the midst of the chaos, he took a tour of the islands with Worden. Musk began thinking
aloud about how the islands could be unified into one landmass. He suggested that walls could be
built through the small channels between the islands, and the water could be pumped out in the spirit
of the manmade systems in the Netherlands. Worden, also known for his out-there ideas, was attracted
to Musk’s bravado. “That he is thinking of this stuff is kind of cool,” Worden said. “From that point
on, he and I discussed settling Mars. It really impressed me that this is a guy that thinks big.”PHOTOGRAPHIC INSERT

J. B. STRAUBEL HAS A TWO-INCH-LONG SCAR that cuts across the middle of his left cheek.
He earned it in high school, during a chemistry class experiment. Straubel whipped up the wrong
concoction of chemicals, and the beaker he was holding exploded, throwing off shards of glass, one
of which sliced through his face.
The wound lingers as a tinkerer’s badge of honor. It arrived near the end of a childhood full of
experimentation with chemicals and machines. Born in Wisconsin, Straubel constructed a large
chemistry lab in the basement of his family’s home that included fume hoods and chemicals ordered,
borrowed, or pilfered. At thirteen, Straubel found an old golf cart at the dump. He brought it back
home and restored it to working condition, which required him to rebuild the electric motor. It
seemed that Straubel was always taking something apart, sprucing it up, and putting it back together.
All of this fit into the Straubel family’s do-it-yourself traditions. In the late 1890s Straubel’s greatgrandfather started the Straubel Machine Company, which built one of the first internal combustion
engines in the United States and used it to power boats.
Straubel’s inquisitive spirit carried him west to Stanford University, where he enrolled in 1994
intending to become a physicist. After flying through the hardest courses he could take, Straubel
concluded that majoring in physics would not be for him. The advanced courses were too theoretical,
and Straubel liked to get his hands dirty. He developed his own major called energy systems and
engineering. “I wanted to take software and electricity and use it to control energy,” Straubel said. “It
was computing combined with power electronics. I collected all the things I love doing in one place.”
There was no clean-technology movement at this time, but there were companies dabbling with
new uses for solar power and electric vehicles. Straubel ended up hunting down these startups,
hanging out in their garages and pestering the engineers. He began tinkering once again on his own as
well in the garage of a house he shared with a half dozen friends. Straubel bought a “piece of shit
Porsche” for $1,600 and turned it into an electric car. This meant that Straubel had to create a
controller to manage the electric motor, build a charger from scratch, and write the software that
made the entire machine work. The car set the world record for electric vehicle (EV) acceleration,
traveling a quarter mile in 17.28 seconds. “The thing I took away was that the electronics were great,
and you could get acceleration on a shoestring budget, but the batteries sucked,” Straubel said. “It had
a thirty-mile range, so I learned firsthand about some of the limitations of electric vehicles.” Straubel
gave his car a hybrid boost, building a gasoline-powered contraption that could be towed behind the
Porsche and used to recharge the batteries. It was good enough for Straubel to drive the four hundred
miles down to Los Angeles and back.
By 2002, Straubel was living in Los Angeles. He’d gotten a master’s degree from Stanford and
bounced around a couple of companies looking for something that called out to him. He decided on
Rosen Motors, which had built one of the world’s first hybrid vehicles—a car that ran off a flywheel
and a gas turbine and had electric motors to drive the wheel. After it folded, Straubel followed
Harold Rosen, an engineer famed for inventing the geostationary satellite, to create an electric plane.“I’m a pilot and love to fly, so this was perfect for me,” Straubel said. “The idea was that it would
stay aloft for two weeks at a time and hover over a specific spot. This was way before drones and all
that.” To help make ends meet, Straubel also worked nights and on the weekend doing electronics
consulting for a start-up.
It was in the midst of toiling away on all these projects that Straubel’s old buddies from the
Stanford solar car team came to pay him a visit. A group of rogue engineers at Stanford had been
working on solar cars for years, building them in a World War II–era Quonset hut full of toxic
chemicals and black widows. Unlike today, when the university would jump at the chance to support
such a project, Stanford tried to shut down this group of fringe freaks and geeks. The students proved
very capable of doing the work on their own and competed in cross-country solar-powered car races.
Straubel helped build the vehicles during his time at university and even after, forming relationships
with the incoming crop of engineers. The team had just raced 2,300 miles from Chicago to Los
Angeles, and Straubel offered the strapped, exhausted kids a place to stay. About a half dozen
students showed up at Straubel’s place, took their first showers in many days, and then spread across
his floor. As they chatted late into the night, Straubel and the solar team kept fixating on one topic.
They realized that lithium ion batteries—such as the ones in their car being fed by the sun—had gotten
much better than most people realized. Many consumer electronics devices like laptops were running
on so-called 18650 lithium ion batteries, which looked a lot like AA batteries and could be strung
together. “We wondered what would happen if you put ten thousand of the battery cells together,”
Straubel said. “We did the math and figured you could go almost one thousand miles. It was totally
nerdy shit, and eventually everyone fell asleep, but the idea really stuck with me.”
Soon enough, Straubel was stalking the solar car crew, trying to talk them into building an electric
car based on the lithium ion batteries. He would fly up to Palo Alto, spend the night sleeping in his
plane, and then ride a bicycle to the Stanford campus to make his sales pitch while helping with their
current projects. The design Straubel had come up with was a super-aerodynamic vehicle with 80
percent of its mass made up of the batteries. It looked quite a bit like a torpedo on wheels. No one
knew the exact details of Straubel’s long-term vision for this thing, including Straubel. The plan
seemed to be less about forming a car company than about building a proof-of-concept vehicle just to
get people thinking about the power of the lithium ion batteries. With any luck, they would find a race
to compete in.
The Stanford students agreed to join Straubel, if he could raise some money. He began going to
trade shows handing out brochures about his idea and e-mailing just about anyone he could think of. “I
was shameless,” he said. The only problem was that no one had any interest in what Straubel was
selling. Investors dealt him one rejection after another for months on end. Then, in the fall of 2003,
Straubel met Elon Musk.
Harold Rosen had set up a lunch with Musk at a seafood restaurant near the SpaceX headquarters
in Los Angeles and brought Straubel along to help talk up the electric plane idea. When Musk didn’t
bite on that, Straubel announced his electric car side project. The crazy idea struck an immediate
chord with Musk, who had been thinking about electric vehicles for years. While Musk had mostly
focused on using ultracapacitors for the vehicles, he was thrilled and surprised to hear how far the
lithium ion battery technology had progressed. “Everyone else had told me I was nuts, but Elon loved
the idea,” Straubel said. “He said, ‘Sure, I will give you some money.’” Musk promised Straubel
$10,000 of the $100,000 he was seeking. On the spot, Musk and Straubel formed a kinship that wouldsurvive more than a decade of extreme highs and lows as they set out to do nothing less than change
the world.
After the meeting with Musk, Straubel reached out to his friends at AC Propulsion. The Los
Angeles–based company started in 1992 and was the bleeding edge of electric vehicles, building
everything from zippy midsize passenger jobs right on up to sports cars. Straubel really wanted to
show Musk the tzero (from “t-zero”)—the highest-end vehicle in AC Propulsion’s stable. It was a
type of kit car that had a fiberglass body sitting on top of a steel frame and went from zero to 60 miles
per hour in 4.9 seconds when first unveiled in 1997. Straubel had spent years hanging out with the AC
Propulsion crew and asked Tom Gage, the company’s president, to bring a tzero over for Musk to
drive. Musk fell for the car. He saw its potential as a screaming-fast machine that could shift the
perception of electric cars from boring and plodding to something aspirational. For months Musk
offered to fund an effort to transform the kit car into a commercial vehicle but got rebuffed time and
again. “It was a proof of concept and needed to be made real,” Straubel said. “I love the hell out of
the AC Propulsion guys, but they were sort of hopeless at business and refused to do it. They kept
trying to sell Elon on this car called the eBox that looked like shit, didn’t have good performance, and
was just uninspiring.” While the meetings with AC Propulsion didn’t result in a deal, they had
solidified Musk’s interest in backing something well beyond Straubel’s science project. In a late
February 2004 e-mail to Gage, Musk wrote, “What I’m going to do is figure out the best choice of a
high performance base car and electric powertrain and go in that direction.”
Unbeknownst to Straubel, at about the same time, a couple of business partners in Northern
California had also fallen in love with the idea of making a lithium ion battery powered car. Martin
Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning had founded NuvoMedia in 1997 to create one of the earliest
electronic book readers, called the Rocket eBook. The work at NuvoMedia had given the men insight
into cutting-edge consumer electronics and the hugely improved lithium ion batteries used to power
laptops and other portable devices. While the Rocket eBook was too far ahead of its time and not a
major commercial success, it was innovative enough to attract the attention of Gemstar International
Group, which owned TV Guide and some electronic programming guide technology. Gemstar paid
$187 million to acquire NuvoMedia in March 2000. Spoils in hand, the cofounders stayed in touch
after the deal. They both lived in Woodside, one of the wealthiest towns in Silicon Valley, and chatted
from time to time about what they should tackle next. “We thought up some goofball things,” said
Tarpenning. “There was one plan for these fancy irrigation systems for farms and the home based on
smart water-sensing networks. But nothing really resonated, and we wanted something more
important.”
Eberhard was a supremely talented engineer with a do-gooder’s social conscience. The United
States’ repeated conflicts in the Middle East bothered him, and like many other science-minded folks
around 2000 he had started to accept global warming as a reality. Eberhard began looking for
alternatives to gas-guzzling cars. He investigated the potential of hydrogen fuel cells but found them
lacking. He also didn’t see much point in leasing something like the EV1 electric car from General
Motors. What did catch Eberhard’s interest, however, were the all-electric cars from AC Propulsion
that he spied on the Internet. Eberhard went down to Los Angeles around 2001 to visit the AC
Propulsion shop. “The place looked like a ghost town and like they were going out of business,”
Eberhard said. “I bailed them out with five hundred thousand dollars so that they could build one of
their cars for me with lithium ion instead of lead acid batteries.” Eberhard too tried to goad ACPropulsion into being a commercial enterprise rather than a hobby shop. When they rejected his
overtures, Eberhard decided to form his own company and see what the lithium ion batteries could
really do.
Eberhard’s journey began with him building a technical model of the electric car on a
spreadsheet. This let him tweak various components and see how they might affect the vehicle’s shape
and performance. He could adjust the weight, number of batteries, resistance of the tires and body,
and then get back answers on how many batteries it would take to power the various designs. The
models made it clear that SUVs, which were very popular at the time, and things like delivery trucks
were unlikely candidates. The technology seemed instead to favor a lighter-weight, high-end sports
car, which would be fast, fun to drive, and have far better range than most people would expect.
These technical specifications complemented the findings of Tarpenning, who had been doing
research into a financial model for the car. The Toyota Prius had started to take off in California, and
it was being purchased by wealthy eco-crusaders. “We also learned that the average income for EV1
owners was around two hundred thousand dollars per year,” Tarpenning said. People who used to go
after the Lexus, BMW, and Cadillac brands saw electric and hybrid cars as a different kind of status
symbol. The men figured they could build something for the $3 billion per year luxury auto market in
the United States that would let rich people have fun and feel good about themselves too. “People pay
for cool and sexy and an amazing zero-to-sixty time,” Tarpenning said.
On July 1, 2003, Eberhard and Tarpenning incorporated their new company. While at Disneyland
a few months earlier on a date with his wife, Eberhard had come up with the name Tesla Motors, both
to pay homage to the inventor and electric motor pioneer Nikola Tesla and because it sounded cool.
The cofounders rented an office that had three desks and two small rooms in a decrepit 1960s
building located at 845 Oak Grove Avenue in Menlo Park. The third desk was occupied a few months
later by Ian Wright, an engineer who grew up on a farm in New Zealand. He was a neighbor of the
Tesla cofounders in Woodside, and had been working with them to hone his pitch for a networking
startup. When the start-up failed to raise any money from venture capitalists, Wright joined Tesla. As
the three men began to tell some of their confidants of their plans, they were confronted with universal
derision. “We met a friend at this Woodside pub to tell her what we had finally decided to do and that
it was going to be an electric car,” Tarpenning said. “She said, ‘You have to be kidding me.’”
Anyone who tries to build a car company in the United States is quickly reminded that the last
successful start-up in the industry was Chrysler, founded in 1925. Designing and building a car from
the ground up comes with plenty of challenges, but it’s really getting the money and know-how to
build lots of cars that has thwarted past efforts to get a new company going. The Tesla founders were
aware of these realities. They figured that Nikola Tesla had built an electric motor a century earlier
and that creating a drivetrain to take the power from the motor and send it to the wheels was doable.
The really frightening part of their enterprise would be building the factory to make the car and its
associated parts. But the more the Tesla guys researched the industry, the more they realized that the
big automakers don’t even really build their cars anymore. The days of Henry Ford having raw
materials delivered to one end of his Michigan factory and then sending cars out the other end had
long passed. “BMW didn’t make its windshields or upholstery or rearview mirrors,” Tarpenning
said. “The only thing the big car companies had kept was internal combustion research, sales and
marketing, and the final assembly. We thought naïvely that we could access all the same suppliers for
our parts.”The plan the Tesla cofounders came up with was to license some technology from AC Propulsion
around the tzero vehicle and to use the Lotus Elise chassis for the body of their car. Lotus, the English
carmaker, had released the two-door Elise in 1996, and it certainly had the sleek, ground-hugging
appeal to make a statement to high-end car buyers. After talking to a number of people in the car
dealership business, the Tesla team decided to avoid selling their cars through partners and sell
direct. With these basics of a plan in place, the three men went hunting for some venture capital
funding in January 2004.
To make things feel more real for the investors, the Tesla founders borrowed a tzero from AC
Propulsion and drove it to the venture capital corridor of Sand Hill Road. The car accelerated faster
than a Ferrari, and this translated into visceral excitement for the investors. The downside, though,
was that venture capitalists are not a terribly imaginative bunch, and they struggled to see past the
crappy plastic finish of this glorified kit car. The only venture capitalists that bit were Compass
Technology Partners and SDL Ventures, and they didn’t sound altogether thrilled. The lead partner at
Compass had made out well on NuvoMedia and felt some loyalty to Eberhard and Tarpenning. “He
said, ‘This is stupid, but I have invested in every automotive start-up for the last forty years, so why
not,’” Tarpenning recalled. Tesla still needed a lead investor who would pony up the bulk of the $7
million needed to make what’s known as a mule or a prototype vehicle. That would be their first
milestone and give them something physical to show off, which could aid a second round of funding.
Eberhard and Tarpenning had Elon Musk’s name in the back of their heads as a possible lead
investor from the outset. They had both seen him speak a couple of years earlier at a Mars Society
conference held at Stanford where Musk had laid out his vision of sending mice into space, and they
got the impression that he thought a bit differently and would be open to the idea of an electric car.
The idea to pitch Musk on Tesla Motors solidified when Tom Gage from AC Propulsion called
Eberhard and told him that Musk was looking to fund something in the electric car arena. Eberhard
and Wright flew down to Los Angeles and met with Musk on a Friday. That weekend, Musk peppered
Tarpenning, who had been away on a trip, with questions about the financial model. “I just remember
responding, responding, and responding,” Tarpenning said. “The following Monday, Martin and I
flew down to meet him again, and he said, ‘Okay, I’m in.’”
The Tesla founders felt like they had lucked into the perfect investor. Musk had the engineering
smarts to know what they were building. He also shared their larger goal of trying to end the United
States’ addiction to oil. “You need angel investors to have some belief, and it wasn’t a purely
financial transaction for him,” Tarpenning said. “He wanted to change the energy equation of the
country.” With an investment of $6.5 million, Musk had become the largest shareholder of Tesla and
the chairman of the company. Musk would later wield his position of strength well while battling
Eberhard for control of Tesla. “It was a mistake,” Eberhard said. “I wanted more investors. But, if I
had to do it again, I would take his money. A bird in the hand, you know. We needed it.”
Not long after this meeting took place, Musk called Straubel and urged him to meet with the Tesla
team. Straubel heard that their offices in Menlo Park were about a half a mile from his house, and he
was intrigued but very skeptical of their story. No one on the planet was more dialed into the electric
vehicle scene than Straubel, and he found it hard to believe that a couple of guys had gotten this far
along without word of their project reaching him. Nonetheless, Straubel stopped by the office for a
meeting, and was hired right away in May 2004 at a salary of $95,000 per year. “I told them that I had
been building the battery pack they need down the street with funding from Elon,” Straubel said. “Weagreed to join forces and formed this ragtag group.”
Had anyone from Detroit stopped by Tesla Motors at this point, they would have ended up in
hysterics. The sum total of the company’s automotive expertise was that a couple of the guys at Tesla
really liked cars and another one had created a series of science fair projects based on technology
that the automotive industry considered ridiculous. What’s more, the founding team had no intention of
turning to Detroit for advice on how to build a car company. No, Tesla would do what every other
Silicon Valley start-up had done before it, which was hire a bunch of young, hungry engineers and
figure things out as they went along. Never mind that the Bay Area had no real history of this model
ever having worked for something like a car and that building a complex, physical object had little in
common with writing a software application. What Tesla did have, ahead of anyone else, was the
realization that 18650 lithium ion batteries had gotten really good and were going to keep getting
better. Hopefully that coupled with some effort and smarts would be enough.
Straubel had a direct pipeline into the smart, energetic engineers at Stanford and told them about
Tesla. Gene Berdichevsky, one of the members of the solar-powered-car team, lit up the second he
heard from Straubel. An undergraduate, Berdichevsky volunteered to quit school, work for free, and
sweep the floors at Tesla if that’s what it took to get a job. The founders were impressed with his
spirit and hired Berdichevsky after one meeting. This left Berdichevsky in the uncomfortable position
of calling his Russian immigrant parents, a pair of nuclear submarine engineers, to tell them that he
was giving up on Stanford to join an electric car start-up. As employee No. 7, he spent part of the
workday in the Menlo Park office and the rest in Straubel’s living room designing three-dimensional
models of the car’s powertrain on a computer and building battery pack prototypes in the garage.
“Only now do I realize how insane it was,” Berdichevsky said.
Tesla soon needed to expand to accommodate its budding engineer army and to create a workshop
that would help bring the Roadster, as they were now calling the car, to life. They found a two-story
industrial building in San Carlos at 1050 Commercial Street. The 10,000-square-foot facility wasn’t
much, but it had room to build a research and development shop capable of knocking out some
prototype cars. There were a couple of large assembly bays on the ride side of the building and two
large rollup doors big enough for cars to drive in and out. Wright divided the open floor space into
segments—motors, batteries, power electronics, and final assembly. The left half of the building was
an office space that had been modified in weird ways by the previous tenant, a plumbing supply
company. The main conference room had a wet bar and a sink where the faucet was a swan’s mouth,
and the hot and cold knobs were wings. Berdichevsky painted the office white on a Sunday night, and
the next week the employees made a field trip to IKEA to buy desks and hopped online to order their
computers from Dell. As for tools, Tesla had a single Craftsman toolbox loaded with hammers, nails,
and other carpentry basics. Musk would visit now and again from Los Angeles and was unfazed by
the conditions, having seen SpaceX grow up in similar surroundings.
The original plan for producing a prototype vehicle sounded simple. Tesla would take the AC
Propulsion tzero powertrain and fit it into the Lotus Elise body. The company had acquired a
schematic for an electric motor design and figured it could buy a transmission from a company in the
United States or Europe and outsource any other parts from Asia. Tesla’s engineers mostly needed to
focus on developing the battery pack systems, wiring the car, and cutting and welding metal as needed
to bring everything together. Engineers love to muck around with hardware, and the Tesla team
thought of the Roadster as something akin to a car conversion project that could be done with two orthree mechanical engineers, and a few assembly people.
The main team of prototype builders consisted of Straubel, Berdichevsky, and David Lyons, a
very clever mechanical engineer and employee No. 12. Lyons had about a decade of experience
working for Silicon Valley companies and had met Straubel a few years before when the two men
struck up a conversation at a 7-Eleven about an electric bike Straubel was riding. Lyons had helped
Straubel pay bills by hiring him as a consultant for a company building a device to measure people’s
core body temperature. Straubel thought he could return the favor by bringing Lyons on early to such
an exciting project. Tesla would benefit in a big way as well. As Berdichevsky put it, “Dave Lyons
knew how to get shit done.”
The engineers bought a blue lift for the car and set it up inside the building. They also purchased
some machine tools, hand tools, and floodlights to work at night and started to turn the facility into a
hotbed of R&D activity. Electrical engineers studied the Lotus’s base-level software to figure out
how it tied together the pedals, mechanical apparatus, and the dashboard gauges. The really advanced
work took place with the battery pack design. No one had ever tried to combine hundreds of lithium
ion batteries in parallel, so Tesla ended up at the cutting edge of the technology.
The engineers started trying to understand how heat would dissipate and current flow would
behave across seventy batteries by supergluing them together into groups called bricks. Then ten
bricks would be placed together, and the engineers would test various types of air and liquid cooling
mechanisms. When the Tesla team had developed a workable battery pack, they stretched the yellow
Lotus Elise chassis five inches and lowered the pack with a crane into the back of the car, where its
engine would normally be. These efforts began in earnest on October 18, 2004, and, rather
remarkably, four months later, on January 27, 2005, an entirely new kind of car had been built by
eighteen people. It could even be driven around. Tesla had a board meeting that day, and Musk zipped
about in the car. He came away happy enough to keep investing. Musk put in $9 million more as Tesla
raised a $13 million funding round. The company now planned to deliver the Roadster to consumers
in early 2006.
Once they’d finished building a second car a few months later, the engineers at Tesla decided they
needed to face up to a massive potential flaw in their electric vehicle. On July 4, 2005, they were at
Eberhard’s house in Woodside celebrating Independence Day and figured it was as good a moment as
any to see what happened when the Roadster’s batteries caught on fire. Someone taped twenty of the
batteries together, put a heating strip wire into the bundle, and set it off. “It went up like a cluster of
bottle rockets,” Lyons said. Instead of twenty batteries, the Roadster would have close to 7,000, and
the thought of what an explosion at that scale would be like horrified the engineers. One of the perks
of an electric car was meant to be that it moved people away from a flammable liquid like gasoline
and the endless explosions that take place in an engine. Rich people were unlikely to pay a high price
for something even more dangerous, and the early nightmare scenario for the employees at Tesla was
that a rich, famous person would get caught in a fire caused by the car. “It was one of those ‘oh shit’
moments,” Lyons said. “That is when we really sobered up.”
Tesla formed a six-person task force to deal with the battery issue. They were pulled off all other
work and given money to begin running experiments. The first explosions started taking place at the
Tesla headquarters, where the engineers filmed them in slow motion. Once saner minds prevailed,
Tesla moved its explosion research to a blast area behind an electrical substation maintained by the
fire department. Blast by blast, the engineers learned a great deal about the inner workings of thebatteries. They developed methods for arranging them in ways that would prevent fires spreading
from one battery to the next and other techniques for stopping explosions altogether. Thousands of
batteries exploded along the way, and the effort was worth it. It was still early days, for sure, but
Tesla was on the verge of inventing battery technology that would set it apart from rivals for years to
come and would become one of the company’s great advantages.
The early success at building two prototype cars, coupled with Tesla’s engineering breakthroughs
around the batteries and other technological pieces, boosted the company’s confidence. It was time to
put Tesla’s stamp on the vehicle. “The original plan had been to do the bare minimum we could get
away with as far as making the car stylistically different from a Lotus but electric,” said Tarpenning.
“Along the way, Elon and the rest of the board said, ‘You only get to do this once. It has to delight the
customer, and the Lotus just isn’t good enough to do that.’”
The Elise’s chassis, or base frame, worked fine for Tesla’s engineering purposes. But the body of
the car had serious issues in both form and function. The door on the Elise was all of a foot tall, and
you were meant to either jump into the car or fall into it, depending on your flexibility and/or dignity.
The body also needed to be longer to accommodate Tesla’s battery pack and a trunk. And Tesla
preferred to make the Roadster out of carbon fiber instead of fiberglass. On these design points, Musk
had a lot of opinion and influence. He wanted a car that Justine could feel comfortable getting into
and that had some measure of practicality. Musk made these opinions clear when he visited Tesla for
board meetings and design reviews.
Tesla hired a handful of designers to mock up new looks for the Roadster. After settling on a
favorite, the company paid to build a quarter-scale model of the vehicle in January 2005 and then a
full-scale model in April. This process provided the Tesla executives with yet another revelation of
everything that went into making a car. “They wrap this shiny Mylar material around the model and
vacuum it, so that you can really see the contours and shine and shadows,” Tarpenning said. The
silver model was then turned into a digital rendering that the engineers could manipulate on their
computers. A British company took the digital file and used it to create a plastic version of the car
called an “aero buck” for aerodynamics testing. “They put it on a boat and shipped it to us, and then
we took it to Burning Man,” Tarpenning said, referring to the annual drug-infused art festival held in
the Nevada desert.
About a year later, after many tweaks and much work, Tesla had a pencils-down moment. It was
May 2006, and the company had grown to a hundred employees. This team built a black version of the
Roadster known as EP1, or engineering prototype one. “It was saying, ‘We now think we know what
we will build,’” Tarpenning said. “You can feel it. It’s a real car, and it’s very exciting.” The arrival
of the EP1 provided a great excuse to show existing investors what their money had bought and to ask
for more funds from a wider audience. The venture capitalists were impressed enough to overlook the
fact that engineers sometimes had to manually fan the car to cool it down in between test drives and
were now starting to grasp Tesla’s long-term potential. Musk once again put money into Tesla—$12
million—and a handful of other investors, including the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson,
VantagePoint Capital Partners, J.P. Morgan, Compass Technology Partners, Nick Pritzker, Larry Page,
and Sergey Brin, joined the $40 million round.*
In July 2006, Tesla decided to tell the world what it had been up to. The company’s engineers had
built a red prototype—EP2—to complement the black one, and they both went on display at an event
in Santa Clara. The press flocked to the announcement and were quite taken with what they saw. TheRoadsters were gorgeous, two-seater convertibles that could go from zero to 60 in about four
seconds. “Until today,” Musk said at the event, “all electric cars have sucked.”6
Celebrities like then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Disney CEO Michael Eisner
showed up at the event, and many of them took test rides in the Roadsters. The vehicles were so
fragile that only Straubel and a couple of other trusted hands knew how to run them, and they were
swapped out every five minutes to avoid overheating. Tesla revealed that each car would cost about
$90,000 and had a range of 250 miles per charge. Thirty people, the company said, had committed to
buying a Roadster, including the Google cofounders Brin and Page and a handful of other technology
billionaires. Musk promised that a cheaper car—a four-seat, four-door model under $50,000, would
arrive in about three years.
Around the time of this event, Tesla made its debut in the New York Times via a mini-profile on
the company. Eberhard vowed—optimistically—to begin shipments of the Roadster in the middle of
2007, instead of early 2006 as once planned, and laid out Tesla’s strategy of starting with a highpriced, low-volume product and moving down to more affordable products over time, as underlying
technology and manufacturing capabilities advanced. Musk and Eberhard were big believers in this
strategy, having seen it play out with a number of electronic devices. “Cellphones, refrigerators, color
TV’s, they didn’t start off by making a low-end product for masses,” Eberhard told the paper.7 “They
were relatively expensive, for people who could afford it.” While the story was a coup for Tesla,
Musk didn’t appreciate being left out of the article entirely. “We tried to emphasize him, and told the
reporter about him over and over again, but they weren’t interested in the board of the company,”
Tarpenning said. “Elon was furious. He was livid.”
You could understand why Musk might want some of the shine of Tesla to rub off on him. The car
had turned into a cause célèbre of the automotive world. Electric vehicles tended to invoke religious
overreactions from both the pro and con camps, and the appearance of a good-looking, fast electric
car stoked everyone’s passions. Tesla had also turned Silicon Valley into a real threat, at least
conceptually, to Detroit for the first time. The month after the Santa Monica event was the Pebble
Beach Concours d’Elegance, a famous showcase for exotic cars. Tesla had become such a topic of
conversation that the organizers of the event begged to have a Roadster and waived the usual display
fees. Tesla set up a booth, and people showed up by the dozens writing $100,000 checks on the spot
to pre-order their cars. “This was long before Kickstarter, and we just had not thought of trying to do
that,” Tarpenning said. “But then we started getting millions of dollars at these types of events.”
Venture capitalists, celebrities, and friends of Tesla employees began trying to buy their way onto the
waiting list. Some of Silicon Valley’s wealthy elite went so far as to show up at the Tesla office and
knock on the door, looking to buy a car. The entrepreneurs Konstantin Othmer and Bruce Leak, who
had known Musk from his internship days at Rocket Science Games, did just that one weekday and
ended up getting a personal tour of the car from Musk and Eberhard that stretched over a couple of
hours. “At the end we said, ‘We’ll take one,’” Othmer said. “They weren’t actually allowed to sell
cars yet, though, so we joined their club. It cost one hundred thousand dollars, but one of the benefits
of membership was that you’d get a free car.”
As Tesla switched from marketing back into R&D mode, it had some trends working in its favor.
Advances in computing had made it so that small car companies could sometimes punch at the same
weight as the giants of the industry. Years ago, automakers would have needed to make a fleet of cars
for crash testing. Tesla could not afford to do that, and it didn’t have to. The third Roadsterengineering prototype went to the same collision testing facility used by large automakers, giving
Tesla access to top-of-the-line high-speed cameras and other imaging technology. Thousands of other
tests, though, were done by a third party that specialized in computer simulations and saved Tesla
from building a fleet of crash vehicles. Tesla also had equal access to the big guys’ durability tracks
made out of cobblestones and concrete embedded with metal objects. It could replicate 100,000
miles and ten years of wear at these facilities.
Quite often, the Tesla engineers brought their Silicon Valley attitude to the automakers’ traditional
stomping grounds. There’s a break and traction testing track in northern Sweden near the Arctic
Circle where cars get tuned on large plains of ice. It would be standard to run the car for three days
or so, get the data, and return to company headquarters for many weeks of meetings about how to
adjust the car. The whole process of tuning a car can take the entire winter. Tesla, by contrast, sent its
engineers along with the Roadsters being tested and had them analyze the data on the spot. When
something needed to be tweaked, the engineers would rewrite some code and send the car back on the
ice. “BMW would need to have a confab between three or four companies that would all blame each
other for the problem,” Tarpenning said. “We just fixed it ourselves.” Another testing procedure
required that the Roadsters go into a special cooling chamber to check how they would respond to
frigid temperatures. Not wanting to pay the exorbitant costs to use one of these chambers, the Tesla
engineers opted to rent an ice cream delivery truck with a large refrigerated trailer. Someone would
drive a Roadster into the truck, and the engineers would don parkas and work on the car.
Every time Tesla interacted with Detroit it received a reminder of how the once-great city had
been separated from its own can-do culture. Tesla tried to lease a small office in Detroit. The costs
were incredibly low compared with space in Silicon Valley, but the city’s bureaucracy made getting
just a basic office an ordeal. The building’s owner wanted to see seven years of audited financials
from Tesla, which was still a private company. Then the building owner wanted two years’ worth of
advanced rent. Tesla had about $50 million in the bank and could have bought the building outright.
“In Silicon Valley, you say you’re backed by a venture capitalist, and that’s the end of the
negotiation,” Tarpenning said. “But everything was like that in Detroit. We’d get FedEx boxes, and
they couldn’t even decide who should sign for the package.”
Throughout these early years, the engineers credited Eberhard with making quick, crisp decisions.
Rarely did Tesla get hung up overanalyzing a situation. The company would pick a plan of attack, and
when it failed at something, it failed fast and then tried a new approach. It was many of the changes
that Musk wanted that started to delay the Roadster. Musk kept pushing for the car to be more
comfortable, asking for alterations to the seats and the doors. He made the carbon-fiber body a
priority, and he pushed for electronic sensors on the doors so that the Roadster could be unlocked
with the touch of a finger instead of a tug on a handle. Eberhard groused that these features were
slowing the company down, and many of the engineers agreed. “It felt at times like Elon was this
unreasonably demanding overarching force,” said Berdichevsky. “The company as a whole was
sympathetic to Martin because he was there all the time, and we all felt the car should ship sooner.”
By the middle of 2007, Tesla had grown to 260 employees and seemed to be pulling off the
impossible. It had produced the fastest, most beautiful electric car the world had ever seen almost
from thin air. All it had to do next was build a lot of the cars—a process that would end up almost
bankrupting the company.
The greatest mistake Tesla’s executives made in the early days were assumptions around thetransmission system for the Roadster. The goal had always been to get from zero to 60 mph as quickly
as possible in the hopes that the raw speed of the Roadster would attract a lot of attention and make it
fun to drive. To do this, Tesla’s engineers had decided on a two-speed transmission, which is the
underlying mechanism in the car for transferring power from the motor to the wheels. The first gear
would take the car from zero to 60 mph in less than four seconds, and then the second gear would take
the car up to 130 mph. Tesla had hired Xtrac, a British company specializing in transmission designs,
to build this part and had every reason to believe that this would be one of the smoother bits of the
Roadster’s journey. “People had been making transmissions since Robert Fulton built the steam
engine,” said Bill Currie,8 a veteran Silicon Valley engineer and employee No. 86 at Tesla. “We
thought you would just order one. But the first one we had lasted forty seconds.” The initial
transmission could not handle the big jump from the first to the second gear, and the fear was that the
second gear would engage at high speed and not be synchronized with the motor properly, which
would result in catastrophic damage to the car.
Lyons and the other engineers quickly set out to try to fix the issue. They found a couple of other
contractors to design replacements and again hoped that these longtime transmission experts would
deliver something usable with relative ease. It soon became apparent, however, that the contractors
were not always putting their A team to work on this project for a tiny start-up in Silicon Valley and
that the new transmissions were no better than the first. During tests, Tesla found that the
transmissions would sometimes break after 150 miles and that the mean time between failures was
about 2,000 miles. When a team from Detroit ran a root cause analysis of the transmission to find
failures, they discovered fourteen separate issues that could cause the system to break. Tesla had
wanted to deliver the Roadster in November 2007, but the transmission issues lingered, and by the
time January 1, 2008, rolled around, the company had to once again start from scratch, on a third
transmission push.
Tesla also faced issues abroad. The company had decided to send a team of its youngest, most
energetic engineers to Thailand to set up a battery factory. Tesla partnered with an enthusiastic
although not totally capable manufacturing partner. The Tesla engineers had been told that they could
fly over and manage the construction of a state-of-the-art battery factory. Instead of a factory, they
found a concrete slab with posts holding up a roof. The building was about a three-hour drive south
from Bangkok, and had been left mostly open like many of the other factories because of the
incredible heat. The other manufacturing operations dealt with making stoves, tires, and commodities
that could withstand the elements. Tesla had sensitive batteries and electronics, and like parts of the
Falcon 1, they’d be chewed up by the salty, humid conditions. Eventually, Tesla’s partner paid about
$75,000 to put in drywall, coat the floor, and create storage rooms with temperature controls. Tesla’s
engineers ended up working maddening hours trying to train the Thai workers on how to handle the
electronics properly. The development of the battery technology, which had once moved along at a
rapid pace, slowed to a crawl.
The battery factory was one part of a supply chain that stretched across the globe, adding cost and
delays to the Roadster production. Body panels for the car were to be made in France, while the
motors were to come from Taiwan. Tesla planned on buying battery cells in China and shipping them
to Thailand to turn the piece parts into battery packs. The battery packs, which had to be stored for a
minimal amount of time to avoid degradation, would then be taken to port and shipped to England,
where they needed to clear customs. Tesla then planned for Lotus to build the body of the car, attachthe battery packs, and ship the Roadsters by boat around Cape Horn to Los Angeles. In that scenario,
Tesla would have paid for the bulk of the car and had no chance to recognize revenue on the parts
until six to nine months had passed. “The idea was to get to Asia, get things done fast and cheap, and
make money on the car,” said Forrest North, one of the engineers sent to Thailand. “What we found
out was that for really complicated things, you can do the work cheaper here and have less delays and
less problems.” When some new hires came on, they were horrified to discover just how haphazard
Tesla’s plan appeared. Ryan Popple, who had spent four years in the army and then gotten an MBA
from Harvard, arrived at Tesla as a director of finance meant to prep the company to go public. After
examining the company’s books early in his tenure, Popple asked the manufacturing and operations
head exactly how he would get the car made. “He said, ‘Well, we will decide we’re going into
production and then a miracle is going to happen,’” Popple said.
As word of the manufacturing issues reached Musk, he became very concerned about the way
Eberhard had run the company and called in a fixer to address the situation. One of Tesla’s investors
was Valor Equity, a Chicago-based investment firm that specialized in fine-tuning manufacturing
operations. The company had been drawn to Tesla’s battery and powertrain technology and calculated
that even if Tesla failed to sell many cars, the big automakers would end up wanting to buy its
intellectual property. To protect its investment, Valor sent in Tim Watkins, its managing director of
operations, and he soon reached some horrific conclusions.
Watkins is a Brit with degrees in industrial robotics and electrical engineering. He’s built up a
reputation as an ingenious solver of problems. While doing work in Switzerland, for example,
Watkins found a way to get around the country’s rigid labor laws that limit the hours employees can
work, by automating a metal stamping factory so that it could run twenty-four hours per day instead of
sixteen hours like the factories or rivals. Watkins is also known for keeping his ponytail in place with
a black scrunchie, wearing a black leather jacket, and toting a black fanny pack everywhere he goes.
The fanny pack has his passport, checkbook, earplugs, sunscreen, food, and an assortment of other
necessities. “It’s full of the everyday things I need to survive,” said Watkins. “If I walk ten feet away
from this thing, I sense it.” While a bit eccentric, Watkins was thorough and spent weeks talking to
employees and analyzing every part of Tesla’s supply chain to figure out how much it cost to make the
Roadster.
Tesla had done a decent job of keeping its employee costs down. It hired the kid fresh out of
Stanford for $45,000 rather than the proven guy who probably didn’t want to work that hard anyway
for $120,000. But when it came to equipment and materials, Tesla was a spending horror show. No
one liked using the company’s software that tracked the bill of materials. So some people used it, and
some people didn’t. Those that did use it often made huge errors. They would take the cost of a part
from the prototype cars and then estimate how much of a discount they expected when buying that part
in bulk, rather than actually negotiating to find a viable price. At one point, the software declared that
each Roadster should cost about $68,000, which would leave Tesla making about $30,000 per
vehicle. Everyone knew the figure was wrong, but it got reported to the board anyway.
Around the middle of 2007, Watkins came to Musk with his findings. Musk was prepared for a
high figure but felt confident that the price of the car would come down significantly over time as
Tesla ironed out its manufacturing process and increased its sales. “That’s when Tim told me it was
really bad news,” Musk said. It looked like each Roadster could cost up to $200,000 to make, and
Tesla planned to sell the car for only around $85,000. “Even in full production, they would have beenlike $170,000 or something insane,” Musk said. “Of course, it didn’t much matter because about a
third of the cars didn’t flat-out fucking work.”
Eberhard made attempts to pull his team out of this mess. He’d gone to see a speech in which the
famous venture capitalist John Doerr, who became a major investor in green technology companies,
declared that he would devote his time and money to trying to save the Earth from global warming
because he owed such an effort to his children. Eberhard promptly returned to the Tesla building and
ginned up a similar speech. In front of about a hundred people, Eberhard had a picture of his young
daughter projected onto the wall of the main workshop. He asked the Tesla engineers why he had put
that picture up. One of them guessed that it was because people like his daughter would drive the car.
To which Eberhard replied, “No. We are building this because by the time she is old enough to drive
she will know a car as something completely different to how we know it today, just like you don’t
think of a phone as a thing on the wall with a cord on it. It’s this future that depends on you.” Eberhard
then thanked some of the key engineers and called out their efforts in public. Many of the engineers
had been pulling all-nighters on a regular basis and Eberhard’s show boosted morale. “We were all
working ourselves to the point of exhaustion,” said David Vespremi, a former Tesla spokesman.
“Then came this profound moment where we were reminded that building the car was not about
getting to an IPO or selling it to a bunch of rich dudes but because it might change what a car is.”
These victories, though, were not enough to overcome the feeling shared by many of the Tesla
engineers that Eberhard had reached the end of his abilities as a CEO. The company veterans had
always admired Eberhard’s engineering smarts and continued to do so. Eberhard, in fact, had turned
Tesla into a cult of engineering. Regrettably, other parts of the company had been neglected, and
people doubted Eberhard’s ability to take the company from the R&D stage to production. The
ridiculous cost of the car, the transmission, the ineffective suppliers were crippling Tesla. And, as the
company started to miss its delivery dates, many of the once-fanatical consumers who had made their
large up-front payments turned on Tesla and Eberhard. “We saw the writing on the wall,” Lyons said.
“Everyone knew that the person who starts a company is not necessarily the right person to lead it in
the long term, but whenever that is the case, it’s not easy.”
Eberhard and Musk had battled for years over some of the design points on the car. But for the
most part, they had gotten along well enough. Neither man suffered fools. And they certainly shared
many of the same visions for the battery technology and what it could mean to the world. What their
relationship could not survive were the cost figures for the Roadster unearthed by Watkins. It looked
to Musk as if Eberhard had grossly mismanaged the company by allowing the parts costs to soar so
high. Then, as Musk saw it, Eberhard failed to disclose the severity of the situation to the board.
While on his way to give a talk to the Motor Press Guild in Los Angeles, Eberhard received a call
from Musk and in a brief, uncomfortable chat learned that he would be replaced as CEO.
In August 2007, Tesla’s board demoted Eberhard and named him president of technology, which
only exacerbated the company’s issues. “Martin was so bitter and disruptive,” Straubel said. “I
remember him running around the office and sowing discontent, as we’re trying to finish the car and
are running out of money and everything is at knife’s edge.” As Eberhard saw it, other people at Tesla
had foisted a wonky finance software application on him that made it tricky to accurately track costs.
He contended that the delays and cost increases were partly due to the requests of other members of
the management team and that he’d been up front with the board about the issues. Beyond that, he
thought Watkins had made the situation out to be worse than it really was. Start-ups in Silicon Valleyview mayhem as standard operating procedure. “Valor was used to dealing with older companies,”
Eberhard said. “They found chaos and weren’t used to it. This was the chaos of a start-up.” Eberhard
had also already been asking Tesla’s board to replace him as CEO and find someone with more
manufacturing experience.
A few months passed, and Eberhard remained pissed-off. Many of the Tesla employees felt like
they were caught in the middle of a divorce and had to pick their parent—Eberhard or Musk. By the
time December arrived, the situation was untenable, and Eberhard left the company altogether. Tesla
said in a statement that Eberhard had been offered a position on its advisory board, although he
denied that. “I am no longer with Tesla Motors—neither on its board of directors nor an employee of
any sort,” Eberhard said in a statement at the time. “I’m not happy with the way I was treated.” Musk
sent a note to a Silicon Valley newspaper saying, “I’m sorry that it came to this and wish it were not
so. It was not a question of personality differences, as the decision to have Martin transition to an
advisory role was unanimous among the board. Tesla has operational problems that need to be solved
and if the board thought there was any way that Martin could be part of the solution, then he would
still be an employee of the company.”9 These statements were the start of a war that would drag on
between the two men in public for years and that in many ways continues to the present day.
As 2007 played out, the problems mounted for Tesla. The carbon-fiber body that looked so good
turned out to be a huge pain to paint, and Tesla had to cycle through a couple of companies to find one
that could do the work well. Sometimes there were faults in the battery pack. The motor shortcircuited now and again. The body panels had visible gaps. The company also had to face up to the
reality that a two-speed transmission was not going to happen. In order for the Roadster to achieve its
flashy zero-to-60 times with a single-speed transmission, Tesla’s engineers had to redesign the car’s
motor and inverter and shave off some weight. “We essentially had to do a complete reboot,” Musk
said. “That was terrible.”
After Eberhard was removed as CEO, Tesla’s board tapped Michael Marks as its interim chief.
Marks had run Flextronics, an enormous electronics supplier, and had deep experience with complex
manufacturing operations and logistics issues. Marks began interrogating various groups at the
company to try to figure out their problems and to prioritize the issues plaguing the Roadster. He also
put in some basic rules like making sure that people all showed up at work at the same time to
establish a baseline of productivity—a tricky ask in Silicon Valley’s work anywhere, anytime culture.
All of these moves were part of the Marks List, a 10-point, 100-day plan that included eliminating all
faults in the battery packs, getting gaps between body parts to less than 40 mm, and booking a
specified number of reservations. “Martin had been falling apart and lacked a lot of the discipline key
for a manager,” Straubel said. “Michael came in and evaluated the mess and was a bullshit filter. He
didn’t really have a dog in the fight and could say, ‘I don’t care what you think or what you think. This
is what we should do.’” For a while, Marks’s strategy worked, and the engineers at Tesla could once
again focus on building the Roadster rather than on internal politics. But then Marks’s vision for the
company began to diverge from Musk’s.
By this time, Tesla had moved into a larger facility at 1050 Bing Street in San Carlos. The bigger
building allowed Tesla to bring the battery work back in-house from Asia and for it to do some of the
Roadster manufacturing, alleviating the supply chain issues. Tesla was maturing as a car company,
although its wild-child start-up streak remained well intact. While strolling around the factory one
day, Marks saw a Smart car from Daimler on a lift. Musk and Straubel had a small side project goingon around the Smart car to see what it might be like as an electric vehicle. “Michael didn’t know
about it, and he’s like, ‘Who is the CEO here?’” said Lyons. (The work on the Smart car eventually
led to Daimler buying a 10 percent stake in Tesla.)
Marks’s inclination was to try to package Tesla as an asset that could be sold to a larger car
company. It was a perfectly reasonable plan. While running Flextronics, Marks had overseen a vast,
global supply chain and knew the difficulties of manufacturing intimately. Tesla must have looked
borderline hopeless to him at this point. The company could not make its one product well, was
poised to hemorrhage money, and had missed a string of delivery deadlines and yet its engineers were
still off doing side experiments. Making Tesla look as pretty as possible for a suitor was the rational
thing to do.
In just about every other case, Marks would be thanked for his decisive plan of action and saving
the company’s investors from a big loss. But Musk had little interest in polishing up Tesla’s assets for
the highest bidder. He’d started the company to put a dent in the automotive industry and force people
to rethink electric cars. Instead of doing the fashionable Silicon Valley thing of “pivoting” toward a
new idea or plan, Musk would dig in deeper. “The product was late and over budget and everything
was wrong, but Elon didn’t want anything to do with those plans to either sell the whole company or
lose control through a partnership,” Straubel said. “So, Elon decided to double down.”
On December 3, 2007, Ze’ev Drori replaced Marks as CEO. Drori had experience in Silicon
Valley starting a company that made computer memory and selling it to the chipmaker Advanced
Micro Devices. Drori was not Musk’s first pick—a top choice had turned down the job because he
didn’t want to move from the East Coast—and did not inspire much enthusiasm from the Tesla
employees. Drori had about fifteen years on the youngest Tesla worker and no connection to this
group bonded by suffering and toil. He came to be seen more as an executor of Musk’s wishes than as
a commanding, independent CEO.
Musk began making more public gestures to mitigate the bad press around Tesla. He issued
statements and did interviews, promising that the Roadster would ship to customers in early 2008. He
began talking up a car code-named WhiteStar—the Roadster had been code-named DarkStar—that
would be a sedan possibly priced around $50,000, and a new factory to build the machine. “Given
the recent management changes, some reassurances are in order regarding Tesla Motors’ future
plans,” Musk wrote in a blog post. “The near term message is simple and unequivocal—we are going
to deliver a great sports car next year that customers will love driving. . . . My car, production VIN 1,
is already off the production line in the UK and final preparations are being made for importation.”
Tesla held a series of town hall meetings with customers where it tried to fess up to its problems in
the open, and it started building some showrooms for its car. Vince Sollitto, the former PayPal
executive, visited the Menlo Park showroom and found Musk complaining about the public relations
issues but clearly inspired by the product Tesla was building. “His demeanor changed the moment we
got to this display of the motor,” Sollitto said. Dressed in a leather jacket and slacks, Musk started
talking about the motor’s properties and then put on a performance worthy of a carnival strongman by
lifting the hundred-or-so-pound hunk of metal. “He picks this thing up and wedges it between his two
palms,” Sollitto said. “He’s holding it, and he’s shaking and beads of sweat are forming on his
forehead. It wasn’t so much a display of strength as a physical demonstration of the beauty of the
product.” While the customers complained a lot about the delays, they seemed to sense this passion
from Musk and share his enthusiasm for the product. Only a handful of customers asked for theirprepayments back.
Tesla employees soon got to witness the same Musk that SpaceX employees had seen for years.
When an issue like the Roadster’s faulty carbon-fiber body panels cropped up, Musk dealt with it
directly. He flew to England in his jet to pick up some new manufacturing tools for the body panels
and personally delivered them to a factory in France to ensure that the Roadster stayed on its
production schedule. The days of people being ambiguous about the Roadster’s manufacturing costs
were gone as well. “Elon got fired up and said we were going to do this intense cost-down program,”
said Popple. “He gave a speech, saying we would work on Saturdays and Sundays and sleep under
desks until it got done. Someone pushed back from the table and argued that everyone had been
working so hard just to get the car done, and they were ready for a break and to see their families.
Elon said, ‘I would tell those people they will get to see their families a lot when we go bankrupt.’ I
was like, ‘Wow,’ but I got it. I had come out of a military culture, and you just have to make your
objective happen.” Employees were required to meet at 7 A.M. every Thursday morning for bill-ofmaterials updates. They had to know the price of every part and have a cogent plan for getting parts
cheaper. If the motor cost $6,500 a pop at the end of December, Musk wanted it to cost $3,800 by
April. The costs were plotted and analyzed each month. “If you started falling behind, there was hell
to pay,” Popple said. “Everyone could see it, and people lost their jobs when they didn’t deliver.
Elon has a mind that’s a bit like a calculator. If you put a number on the projector that does not make
sense, he will spot it. He doesn’t miss details.” Popple found Musk’s style aggressive, but he liked
that Musk would listen to a well-argued, analytical point and often change his mind if given a good
enough reason. “Some people thought Elon was too tough or hot-tempered or tyrannical,” Popple
said. “But these were hard times, and those of us close to the operational realities of the company
knew it. I appreciated that he didn’t sugarcoat things.”
On the marketing front, Musk would run daily Google searches for news stories about Tesla. If he
saw a bad story, he ordered someone to “fix it” even though the Tesla public relations people could
do little to sway the reporters. One employee missed an event to witness the birth of his child. Musk
fired off an e-mail saying, “That is no excuse. I am extremely disappointed. You need to figure out
where your priorities are. We’re changing the world and changing history, and you either commit or
you don’t.”*
Marketing people who made grammatical mistakes in e-mails were let go, as were other people
who hadn’t done anything “awesome” in recent memory. “He can be incredibly intimidating at times
but doesn’t have a real sense for just how imposing he can be,” said one former Tesla executive.
“We’d have these meetings and take bets on who was going to get bloodied and bruised. If you told
him that you made a particular choice because ‘it was the standard way things had always been done,’
he’d kick you out of a meeting fast. He’d say, ‘I never want to hear that phrase again. What we have to
do is fucking hard and half-assing things won’t be tolerated.’ He just destroys you and, if you survive,
he determines if he can trust you. He has to understand that you’re as crazy as he is.” This ethos
filtered through the entire company, and everyone quickly understood that Musk meant business.
Straubel, while sometimes on the bad end of the critiques, welcomed Musk’s hard-charging
presence. The five years to get to this point had been an enjoyable slog for him. Straubel had
transformed from a quiet, capable engineer who shuffled around Tesla’s factory floor with his head
down into the most crucial member of the technical team. He knew more about the batteries and the
electric drivetrain than just about anyone else at the company. He also began developing a role as ago-between for employees and Musk. Straubel’s engineering smarts and work ethic had earned
Musk’s respect, and Straubel found that he could deliver difficult messages to Musk on behalf of other
employees. As he would do for years to come, Straubel also proved willing to check his ego at the
door. All that mattered was getting the Roadster and the follow-on sedan to market to popularize
electric cars, and Musk looked like the best person to make that happen.
Other employees had enjoyed the thrill of the engineering challenge over the past five years but
were burnt-out beyond repair. Wright didn’t believe that an electric car for the masses would ever
take off. He left and started his own company dedicated to making electric versions of delivery
trucks. Berdichevsky had been a crucial, do-anything young engineer for much of Tesla’s existence.
Now that the company employed about three hundred people, he felt less effective and didn’t relish
the idea of suffering for another five years to bring the sedan to market. He would leave Tesla, get a
couple of degrees from Stanford, and cofound a start-up looking to make a revolutionary new battery
that could soon go into electric cars. With Eberhard gone, Tarpenning found Tesla less fun. He didn’t
see eye to eye with Drori and also shied away from the idea of frying his soul to get the sedan out.
Lyons stuck around longer, which is a minor miracle. At various points, he had led the development of
most of the core technology behind the Roadster, including the battery packs, the motor, the power
electronics, and, yes, the transmission. This meant that for about five years Lyons had been among
Tesla’s most capable employees and the guy constantly in the doghouse for being behind on something
and thus holding the rest of the company up. He suffered through some of Musk’s more colorful
tirades—directed either at him or suppliers that had let Tesla down—that included talk of people’s
balls being chopped off and other violent or sexual acts. Lyons also saw an exhausted, stressed-out
Musk spit coffee across a conference room table because it was cold and then, without a pause,
demand that the employees work harder, do more, and mess up less. Like so many people privy to
these performances, Lyons came away with no illusions about Musk’s personality but with the utmost
respect for his vision and drive to execute. “Working at Tesla back then was like being Kurtz in
Apocalypse Now,” Lyons said. “Don’t worry about the methods or if they’re unsound. Just get the job
done. It comes from Elon. He listens, asks good questions, is fast on his feet, and gets to the bottom of
things.”
Tesla could survive the loss of some of these early hires. Its strong brand had allowed the
company to keep recruiting top talent, including people from large automotive companies who knew
how to get over the last set of challenges blocking the Roadster from reaching customers. But Tesla’s
major issue no longer revolved around effort, engineering, or clever marketing. Heading into 2008,
the company was running out of money. The Roadster had cost about $140 million to develop, way
over the $25 million originally estimated in the 2004 business plan. Under normal circumstances,
Tesla had probably done enough to raise more funds. These, however, were not normal times. The big
automakers in the United States were charging toward bankruptcy in the middle of the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. In the midst of all this, Musk needed to convince Tesla’s investors
to fork over tens of millions of additional dollars, and those investors had to go to their constituents to
lay out why this made any sense. As Musk put it, “Try to imagine explaining that you’re investing in
an electric car company, and everything you read about the car company sounds like it is shit and
doomed and it’s a recession and no one is buying cars.” All Musk had to do to dig Tesla out of this
conundrum was lose his entire fortune and verge on a nervous breakdown.8PAIN, SUFFERING, AND SURVIVAL
AS HE PREPARED TO BEGIN FILMING IRON MAN IN EARLY 2007, the director Jon Favreau
rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once belonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and
defense contractor started about eighty years earlier by Howard Hughes. The facility had a series of
interlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie. It also supplied Robert Downey
Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human creator Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration.
Downey felt nostalgic looking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of disrepair.
Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of a big man who shook up industries
and did things his own way.
Downey heard some rumblings about a Hughes-like figure named Elon Musk who had constructed
his own, modern-day industrial complex about ten miles away. Instead of visualizing how life might
have been for Hughes, Downey could perhaps get a taste of the real thing. He set off in March 2007
for SpaceX’s headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a personal tour from Musk. “My
mind is not easily blown, but this place and this guy were amazing,” Downey said.
To Downey, the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware store. Enthusiastic
employees were zipping about, fiddling with an assortment of machines. Young white-collar
engineers interacted with blue-collar assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine
excitement for what they were doing. “It felt like a radical start-up company,” Downey said. After the
initial tour, Downey came away pleased that the sets being hammered out at the Hughes factory did
have parallels to the SpaceX factory. “Things didn’t feel out of place,” he said.
Beyond the surroundings, Downey really wanted a peek inside Musk’s psyche. The men walked,
sat in Musk’s office, and had lunch. Downey appreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety,
coder whack job. What Downey picked up on instead were Musk’s “accessible eccentricities” and
the feeling that he was an unpretentious sort who could work alongside the people in the factory. Both
Musk and Stark were the type of men, according to Downey, who “had seized an idea to live by and
something to dedicate themselves to” and were not going to waste a moment.
When he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that Favreau be sure to place
a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark’s workshop. On a superficial level, this would symbolize that Stark
was so cool and connected that he could get a Roadster before it even went on sale. On a deeper
level, the car was to be placed as the nearest object to Stark’s desk so that it formed something of a
bond between the actor, the character, and Musk. “After meeting Elon and making him real to me, I
felt like having his presence in the workshop,” Downey said. “They became contemporaries. Elon
was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more likely they went on some weird
jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.”
After Iron Man came out, Favreau began talking up Musk’s role as the inspiration for Downey’s
interpretation of Tony Stark. It was a stretch on many levels. Musk is not exactly the type of guy who
downs scotch in the back of a Humvee while part of a military convoy in Afghanistan. But the press
lapped up the comparison, and Musk started to become more of a public figure. People who sort ofknew him as “that PayPal guy” began to think of him as the rich, eccentric businessman behind
SpaceX and Tesla.
Musk enjoyed his rising profile. It fed his ego and provided some fun. He and Justine bought a
house in Bel Air. Their neighbor to one side was Quincy Jones, the music producer, and their other
neighbor was Joe Francis, the infamous creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Musk and some
former PayPal executives, having settled their differences, produced Thank You for Smoking and used
Musk’s jet in the movie. While not a hard-drinking carouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood
nightlife and its social scene. “There were just a lot of parties to go to,” said Bill Lee, Musk’s close
friend. “Elon was neighbors with two quasi-celebrities. Our friends were making movies and through
this confluence of our networks, there was something to go out and do every night.” In one interview,
Musk calculated that his life had become 10 percent playboy and 90 percent engineer.10 “We had a
domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a workplace,” Justine wrote in
magazine article. “We went to black-tie fundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood
nightclubs, with Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us. When Google cofounder
Larry Page got married on Richard Branson’s private Caribbean island, we were there, hanging out in
a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono pose with swarms of adoring women outside the
reception tent.”
Justine appeared to relish their status even more than Musk. A writer of fantasy fiction novels, she
kept a blog detailing the couple’s family life and their adventures on the town. In one entry, Justine
had Musk saying that he’d prefer to sleep with Veronica than Betty from the Archie comics and that
he’d like to visit a Chuck E. Cheese sometime. In another entry, she wrote about meeting Leonardo
DiCaprio at a club and having him beg for a free Tesla Roadster, only to be turned down. Justine
handed out nicknames to oft-occurring characters in the blog, so Bill Lee became “Bill the Hotel
Guy” because he owns a hotel in the Dominican Republic, and Joe Francis appeared as “Notorious
Neighbor.” It’s hard to imagine Musk, who keeps to himself, hanging out with someone as ostentatious
as Francis, but the men got along well. When Francis took over an amusement park for his birthday,
Musk attended and then ended up partying at Francis’s house. Justine wrote, “E was there for a bit but
admitted he also found it ‘kind of lame’—he’s been to a couple of parties at NN’s house now and
ends up feeling self-conscious, ‘because it just seems like there are always these skeevy guys
wandering around the house trolling for girls. I don’t want to be seen as one of those guys.’” When
Francis got ready to buy a Roadster, he stopped by the Musks’ house and handed over a yellow
envelope with $100,000 in cash.
For a while, the blog provided a rare, welcome glimpse into the life of an unconventional CEO.
Musk seemed charming. The public learned that he bought Justine a nineteenth-century edition of
Pride and Prejudice, that Musk’s best friends gave him the nickname “Elonius,” and that Musk likes
to place one-dollar wagers on all manner of things—Can you catch herpes from the Great Barrier
Reef? Is it possible to balance two forks with a toothpick?—that he knows he will win. Justine told
one story about Musk traveling to Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, to hang out with Tony
Blair and Richard Branson. A photo of the three men appeared later in the press that depicted Musk
with a vacant stare. “This was E’s I’m-thinking-about-a-rocket-problem stance, which makes me
pretty sure that he had just gotten some kind of bothersome work-related e-mail, and was clearly
oblivious to the fact that a picture was being taken at all,” she wrote. “This is also the reason I get
suck [sic] a kick out of it—the spouse the camera caught is the exact spouse I encountered, say, lastnight en route to the bathroom, standing in the hallway frowning with his arms folded.” Justine letting
the world into the couple’s bathroom should have served as a warning of things to come. Her blog
would soon turn into one of Musk’s worst nightmares.
The press had not run into a guy like Musk for a very long time. His shine as an Internet
millionaire kept getting, well, shinier thanks to PayPal’s ongoing success. He also had an element of
mystery. There was the weird name. And there was the willingness to spend vast sums of money on
spaceships and electric cars, which came across as a combination of daring, flamboyant, and
downright flabbergasting. “Elon Musk has been called ‘part playboy, part space cowboy,’ an image
hardly dispelled by a car collection that has boasted a Porsche 911 Turbo, 1967 Series 1 Jaguar, a
Hamann BMW M5 plus the aforementioned McLaren F1—which he has driven at up to 215mph on a
private airstrip,” a British reporter gushed in 2007. “Then there was the L39 Soviet military jet,
which he sold after becoming a father.” The press had picked up on the fact that Musk tended to talk a
huge game and then struggle to deliver on his promises in time, but they didn’t much care. The game
he talked was so much bigger than anyone else’s that reporters were comfortable giving Musk leeway.
Tesla became the darling of Silicon Valley’s bloggers, who tracked its every move and were
breathless in their coverage. Similarly, reporters covering SpaceX were overjoyed that a young,
feisty company had arrived to needle Boeing, Lockheed, and, to a large extent, NASA. All Musk had
to do was eventually bring some of these wondrous things he’d been funding to market.
While Musk put on a good show for the public and press, he’d started to get very worried about
his businesses. SpaceX’s second launch attempt had failed, and the reports coming in from Tesla kept
getting worse. Musk had started these two adventures with a fortune nearing $200 million and had
chewed through more than half the money with little to show for it. As each Tesla delay turned into a
PR fiasco, the Musk glow dimmed. People in Silicon Valley began to gossip about Musk’s money
problems. Reporters who months earlier had been heaping adulation on Musk turned on him. The New
York Times picked up on Tesla’s transmission problems. Automotive websites griped that the
Roadster might never ship. By the end of 2007, things got downright nasty. Valleywag, Silicon
Valley’s gossip blog, began to take a particular interest in Musk. Owen Thomas, the site’s lead writer,
dug into the histories of Zip2 and PayPal and played up the times Musk was ousted as CEO to
undermine some of his entrepreneurial street cred. Thomas then championed the premise that Musk
was a master manipulator who played fast and loose with other people’s money. “It’s wonderful that
Musk has realized even a small part of his childhood fantasies,” Thomas wrote. “But he risks
destroying his dreams by refusing to reconcile them with reality.” Valleywag anointed the Tesla
Roadster as its No. 1 fail of 2007 among technology companies.
As his businesses and public persona suffered, Musk’s home life degraded as well. His triplets—
Kai, Damian, and Saxon—had arrived near the end of 2006 and joined their brothers Griffin and
Xavier. According to Musk, Justine suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of the
triplets. “In the spring of 2007, our marriage was having real issues,” Musk said. “It was on the
rocks.” Justine’s blog posts back up his sentiments. She described a much less romantic Musk and felt
people treated her as “an arm ornament who couldn’t possibly have anything interesting to say” rather
than as an author and her husband’s equal. During one trip to St. Barts, the Musks ended up sharing
dinner with some wealthy, influential couples. When Justine let out her political views, one of the
men at the table made a crack about her being so opinionated. “E chuckled back, patted my hand the
way you pat a child’s,” Justine wrote on her blog. From that point on, Justine ordered Musk tointroduce her as a published novelist and not just his wife and mother of his children. The results?
“E’s way of doing this throughout the rest of the trip: ‘Justine wants me to tell you that she’s written
novels,’ which made people look at me like oh, that’s just so cute and didn’t really help my case.”
As 2007 rolled into 2008, Musk’s life became more tumultuous. Tesla basically had to start over
on much of the Roadster, and SpaceX still had dozens of people living in Kwajalein awaiting the next
launch of the Falcon 1. Both endeavors were vacuuming up Musk’s money. He started selling off
prized possessions like the McLaren to generate extra cash. Musk tended to shield employees from
the gravity of his fiscal situation by always encouraging them to do their best work. At the same time,
he personally oversaw all significant purchases at both companies. Musk also trained employees to
make the right trade-offs between spending money and productivity. This struck many of the SpaceX
employees as a novel idea, since they were used to traditional aerospace companies that had huge,
multiyear government contracts and no day-to-day survival pressure. “Elon would always be at work
on Sunday, and we had some chats where he laid out his philosophy,” said Kevin Brogan, the early
SpaceX employee. “He would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that we
were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. It was this very entrepreneurial, Silicon
Valley way of thinking that none of the aerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into.
Sometimes he wouldn’t let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected you to find it
cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he wouldn’t flinch at renting a plane for ninety
thousand dollars to get something to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it. He
would place this urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be ten million dollars a day and
that every day we were slower to achieve our goals was a day of missing out on that money.”
Musk had become all consumed with Tesla and SpaceX out of necessity, and there can be no
doubt that this exacerbated the tensions in his marriage. The Musks had a team of nannies to help with
their five children, but Elon could not spend much time at home. He worked seven days a week and
quite often split his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Justine needed a change. During
moments of self-reflection, she felt sickened, perceiving herself a trophy wife. Justine longed to be
Elon’s partner again and to feel some of that spark from their early days before life had turned so
dazzling and demanding. It’s not clear how much Musk let on to Justine about his dwindling bank
account. She has long maintained that Musk kept her in the dark about the family’s financial
arrangements. But some of Musk’s closest friends did get a glimpse into the worsening financial
situation. In the first half of 2008, Antonio Gracias, the founder and CEO of Valor Equity, met Musk
for dinner. Gracias had been an investor in Tesla and had become one of Musk’s closest friends and
allies, and he could see Musk agonizing over his future. “Things were starting to be difficult with
Justine, but they were still together,” Gracias said. “During that dinner, Elon said, ‘I will spend my
last dollar on these companies. If we have to move into Justine’s parents’ basement, we’ll do it.’”
The option of moving in with Justine’s parents expired on June 16, 2008, when Musk filed for
divorce. The couple did not disclose the situation right away, although Justine left hints on her blog.
In late June, she posted a quotation from Moby without any additional context: “There’s no such thing
as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they wouldn’t try to be a public figure.”
The next entry had Justine house hunting for undisclosed reasons with Sharon Stone, and a couple of
entries later she talked about “a major drama” that she’d been dealing with. In September, Justine
wrote her first blog post explicitly about the divorce, saying, “We had a good run. We married young,
took it as far as we could and now it is over.” Valleywag naturally followed with a story about thedivorce and noted that Musk had been seen out with a twenty-something actress.
The media coverage and divorce freed Justine to write about her private life in a much more
liberated way. In the posts that followed, she gave her account of how the marriage ended, her views
on Musk’s girlfriend and future second wife, and the inner workings of the divorce proceedings. For
the first time, the public had access to a deeply unpleasant portrayal of Musk and received some
firsthand accounts—albeit from an ex-wife—of his hardline behavior. The writing may have been
biased, but it provided a window into how Musk operated. Here’s one post about the lead-up to the
divorce and its rapid execution:
Divorce, for me, was like the bomb you set off when all other options have been exhausted. I
had not yet given up on the diplomacy option, which was why I hadn’t already filed. We were
still in the early stages of marital counseling (three sessions total). Elon, however, took
matters into his own hands—he tends to like to do that—when he gave me an ultimatum:
“Either we fix [the marriage] today, or I will divorce you tomorrow.”
That night, and again the next morning, he asked me what I wanted to do. I stated
emphatically that I was not ready to unleash the dogs of divorce; I suggested that “we” hold
off for at least another week. Elon nodded, touched the top of my head, and left. Later that
same morning I tried to make a purchase and discovered that he had cut off my credit card,
which is when I also knew that he had gone ahead and filed (as it was, E did not tell me
directly; he had another person do it).
For Musk, each online missive from Justine created another public relations crisis that added to
the endless stream of issues faced by his companies. The image he’d sculpted over the years
appeared ready to crumble alongside his businesses. It was a disaster scenario.
Soon enough, the Musks had achieved celebrity divorce status. Mainstream outlets joined
Valleywag in poring over court filings tied to the breakup, particularly as Justine fought for more
money. During the PayPal days, Justine had signed a postnuptial agreement and now argued that she
didn’t really have the time or inclination to dig into the ramifications of the paperwork. Justine took to
her blog in an entry titled “golddigger,” and said she was fighting for a divorce settlement that would
include their house, alimony and child support, $6 million in cash, 10 percent of Musk’s Tesla stock,
5 percent of Musk’s SpaceX stock, and a Tesla Roadster. Justine also appeared on CNBC’s show
Divorce Wars and wrote an article for Marie Claire titled “‘I Was a Starter Wife’: Inside America’s
Messiest Divorce.”
The public tended to side with Justine during all of this and couldn’t quite figure out why a
billionaire was fighting his wife’s seemingly fair requests. A major problem for Musk, of course, was
that his assets were anything but liquid with most of his net worth being tied up in Tesla and SpaceX
stock. The couple eventually settled with Justine getting the house, $2 million in cash (minus her legal
fees), $80,000 a month in alimony and child support for seventeen years, and a Tesla Roadster.*
Years after the settlement, Justine still struggled to speak about her relationship with Musk.
During our interview, she broke down in tears several times and needed moments to compose her
thoughts. Musk, she said, had hidden many things from her during their marriage and ultimately treated
her much like a business adversary to be conquered during the divorce. “We were at war for a while,
and when you go to war with Elon, it’s pretty brutal,” she said. Well after their marriage ended,Justine continued to blog about Musk. She wrote about Riley and provided commentary on his
parenting. One post gave Musk a hard time for banning stuffed animals from the house when their
twins turned seven. Asked about this, Justine said, “Elon is hard-core. He grew up in a tough culture
and tough circumstances. He had to become very tough to not only thrive but to conquer the world. He
doesn’t want to raise soft overprivileged kids with no direction.” Comments like these seemed to
indicate that Justine still admired or at least understood Musk’s strong will.*
In the weeks after he first filed for divorce in mid-June of 2008, Musk tumbled into a deep funk.
Bill Lee started to worry about his friend’s mental state and, as one of Musk’s more free-spirited
friends, wanted to do something to cheer him up. Now and again, Musk and Lee, an investor, would
take trips overseas and mix business and pleasure. The time was right for just such a journey, and they
set off for London at the start of July.
The decompression program began poorly. Musk and Lee visited the headquarters of Aston
Martin to see the company’s CEO and get a tour of his factory. The executive treated Musk like an
amateur car builder, talking down to him and suggesting that he knew more about electric vehicles
than anyone else on the planet. “He was a complete douche,” as Lee put it, and the men did their best
to make a hasty exit back to central London. Along the way, Musk had a nagging stomach pain turn
severe. At the time, Lee was married to Sarah Gore, the daughter of former vice president Al Gore,
who had been a medical student, and so he called her for advice. They decided that Musk might be
suffering from appendicitis, and Lee took him to a medical clinic in the middle of a shopping mall.
When the tests came back negative, Lee set to work trying to goad Musk into a night on the town.
“Elon didn’t want to go out, and I didn’t really, either,” Lee said. “But I was like, ‘No, come on.
We’re all the way here.’”
Lee coaxed Musk into going to a club called Whisky Mist, in Mayfair. People had packed the
small, high-end dance spot and Musk wanted to leave after ten minutes. The well-connected Lee
texted a promoter friend of his, who pulled some strings to get Musk escorted into the VIP area. The
promoter then reached out to some of his prettiest friends, including a twenty-two-year-old up-andcoming actress named Talulah Riley, and they soon arrived at the club as well. Riley and her two
gorgeous friends had come from a charity gala and were in full-length, flowing gowns. “Talulah was
in this huge Cinderella thing,” Lee said. Musk and Riley were introduced by people at the club, and
he perked at the sight of her dazzling figure.
Musk and Riley sat at a table with their friends but immediately zeroed in on each other. Riley had
just hit it big with her portrayal of Mary Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and thought of herself as quite
the hotshot. The older Musk, meanwhile, took on the role of the soft-spoken, sweet engineer. He
whipped out his phone and displayed photos of the Falcon 1 and Roadster, although Riley thought he
had just done some work on these projects and didn’t realize he ran the companies building the
machines. “I remember thinking that this guy probably didn’t get to talk to young actresses a lot and
that he seemed quite nervous,” Riley said. “I decided to be really nice to him and give him a nice
evening. Little did I know that he’d spoken to a lot of pretty girls in his life.”* The more Musk and
Riley talked, the more Lee egged them on. It was the first time in weeks that his friend appeared
happy. “His stomach didn’t hurt; he’s not bummed, this is great,” Lee said. Despite being dressed for
a fairy tale, Riley didn’t fall in love with Musk at first sight. But she did become more impressed and
intrigued as the night went on, particularly after the club promoter introduced Musk to a stunning
model, and he politely said “Hello” and then sat right back down with Riley. “I figured he couldn’t beall bad after that,” said Riley, who then allowed Musk to place his hand on her knee. Musk asked
Riley out to dinner the next night, and she accepted.
With her curvy figure, sultry eyes, and playful good-girl demeanor, Riley was a budding film star
but didn’t really act the part. She grew up in the idyllic English countryside, went to a top school,
and, until a week before she met Musk, had been living at home with her parents. After the night at
Whisky Mist, Riley called her family to tell them about the interesting guy she had met who builds
rockets and cars. Her father used to head up the National Crime Squad and went straight to his
computer to conduct a background check that illuminated Musk’s resume as a married international
playboy with five kids. Riley’s father chided his daughter for being a fool, but she held out hope that
Musk had an explanation and went to dinner with him anyway.
Musk brought Lee to the dinner, and Riley brought her friend Tamsin Egerton, also a beautiful
actress. Things were cooler throughout the meal as the group dined in a depressingly empty
restaurant. Riley waited to see what Musk would bring up on his own. Eventually, he did announce
his five sons and his pending divorce. The confession proved enough to keep Riley interested and
curious about where things would lead. Following the meal, Musk and Riley broke off on their own.
They went for a walk through Soho and then stopped at Cafe Boheme, where Riley, a lifelong
teetotaler, sipped an apple juice. Musk kept Riley’s attention, and the romance began in earnest.
The couple had lunch the next day and then went to the White Cube, a modern art gallery, and then
back to Musk’s hotel room. Musk told Riley, a virgin, that he wanted to show her his rockets. “I was
skeptical, but he did actually show me rocket videos,” she said. Once Musk went back to the United
States,* they kept in touch via e-mail for a couple of weeks, and then Riley booked a flight to Los
Angeles. “I wasn’t even thinking girlfriend or anything like that,” Riley said. “I was just having fun.”
Musk had other ideas. Riley had been in California for just five days when he made his move as
they lay in bed talking in a tiny room at the Peninsula hotel in Beverley Hills. “He said, ‘I don’t want
you to leave. I want you to marry me.’ I think I laughed. Then, he said, ‘No. I’m serious. I’m sorry I
don’t have a ring.’ I said, ‘We can shake on it if you like.’ And we did. I don’t remember what I was
thinking at the time, and all I can say is that I was twenty-two.”
Riley had been a model daughter up to that point, never giving her parents much of anything to
worry about. She did well at school, had scored some tremendous acting gigs, and had a soft, sweet
personality that her friends described as Snow White brought to life. But there she was on the hotel’s
balcony, informing her parents that she had agreed to marry a man fourteen years her senior, who had
just filed for divorce from his first wife, had five kids and two companies, and she didn’t even see
how she could possibly love him after knowing him for a matter of weeks. “I think my mother had a
nervous breakdown,” Riley said. “But I had always been highly romantic, and it actually didn’t strike
me as that strange.” Riley flew back to England to gather her things, and her parents flew back with
her to the United States to meet Musk, who belatedly asked Riley’s father for his blessing. Musk did
not have his own house, which left the couple moving into a home that belonged to Musk’s friend the
billionaire Jeff Skoll. “I had been living there a week when this random guy walked in,” Riley said.
“I said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am the homeowner. Who are you?’ I told him, and then he just
walked out.” Musk later proposed to Riley again on the balcony of Skoll’s house, unveiling a massive
ring. (He has since bought her three engagement rings, including the giant first one, an everyday ring,
and one designed by Musk that has a diamond surrounded by ten sapphires.) “I remember him saying,
‘Being with me was choosing the hard path.’ I didn’t quite understand at the time, but I do now. It’squite hard, quite the crazy ride.”
Riley experienced a baptism by fire. The whirlwind romance had given her the impression that
she was engaged to a world conquering, jet-setting billionaire. That was true in theory but a murkier
proposition in practice. As late July rolled around, Musk could see that he had just enough cash on
hand to scrape through to the end of the year. Both SpaceX and Tesla would need cash infusions at
some point just to pay the employees, and it was unclear where that money would come from with the
world’s financial markets in disarray and investments being put on hold. If things had been going
more smoothly at the companies, Musk could have felt more confident about raising money, but they
were not. “He would come home every day, and there would be some calamity,” Riley said. “He was
under immense pressure from all quarters. It was horrendous.”
SpaceX’s third flight from Kwajalein jumped out as Musk’s most pressing concern. His team of
engineers had remained camped out on the island, preparing the Falcon 1 for another run. A typical
company would focus just on the task at hand. Not SpaceX. It had shipped the Falcon 1 to Kwaj in
April with one set of engineers and then put another group of engineers on a new project to develop
the Falcon 9, a nine-engine rocket that would take the place of the Falcon 5 and serve as a possible
replacement to the retiring space shuttle. SpaceX had yet to prove it could get to space successfully,
but Musk kept positioning it to bid on big-ticket NASA contracts.*
On July 30, 2008, the Falcon 9 had a successful test fire in Texas with all nine of its engines
lighting up and producing 850,000 pounds of thrust. Three days later, in Kwaj, SpaceX’s engineers
fueled up the Falcon 1 and crossed their fingers. The rocket had an air force satellite as its payload,
along with a couple of experiments from NASA. All told, the cargo weighed 375 pounds.
SpaceX had been making significant changes to its rocket since the last, failed launch. A
traditional aerospace company would not have wanted the added risk, but Musk insisted that SpaceX
push its technology forward while at the same time trying to make it work right. Among the biggest
changes for the Falcon 1 was a new version of the Merlin 1 engine that relied on a tweaked cooling
system.
The first launch attempt on August 2, 2008, aborted at T minus zero seconds. SpaceX regrouped
and tried to launch again the same day. This time everything seemed to be going well. The Falcon 1
soared into the sky and flew spectacularly without any indication of a problem. SpaceX employees
watching a webcast of the proceedings back in California let out hoots and whistles. Then, right at the
moment when the first stage and second stage were to separate, there was a malfunction. An analysis
after the fact would show that the new engines had delivered an unexpected thrust during the
separation process that caused the first stage to bump up into the second stage, damaging the top part
of the rocket and its engine.*
The failed launch left many SpaceX employees shattered. “It was so profound seeing the energy
shift over the room in the course of thirty seconds,” said Dolly Singh, a recruiter at SpaceX. “It was
like the worst fucking day ever. You don’t usually see grown-ups weeping, but there they were. We
were tired and broken emotionally.” Musk addressed the workers right away and encouraged them to
get back to work. “He said, ‘Look. We are going to do this. It’s going to be okay. Don’t freak out,’”
Singh recalled. “It was like magic. Everyone chilled out immediately and started to focus on figuring
out what just happened and how to fix it. It went from despair to hope and focus.” Musk put up a
positive front to the public as well. In a statement, he said that SpaceX had another rocket waiting to
attempt a fourth launch and a fifth launch planned shortly after that. “I have also given the go-ahead tobegin fabrication of flight six,” he said. “Falcon 9 development will also continue unabated.”
In reality, the third launch was a disaster with cascading consequences. Since the second stage of
the rocket did not fire properly, SpaceX never got a chance to see if it had really fixed the fuelsloshing issues that had plagued the second flight. Many of the SpaceX engineers were confident that
they had solved this problem and were anxious to get to the fourth launch, believing that they had an
easy answer for the recent thrust problem. For Musk, the situation seemed graver. “I was super
depressed,” Musk said. “If we hadn’t solved the slush coupling problem on flight two, or there was
just some random other thing that occurred—say a mistake in the launch process or the manufacturing
process unrelated to anything previous—then game over.” SpaceX simply did not have enough money
to try a fifth flight. He’d put $100 million into the company and had nothing to spare because of the
issues at Tesla. “Flight four was it,” Musk said. If, however, SpaceX could nail the fourth flight, it
would instill confidence on the part of the U.S. government and possible commercial customers,
paving the way for the Falcon 9 and even more ambitious projects.
Leading up to the third launch, Musk had been his usual ultra-involved self. Anyone at SpaceX
who held the launch back went onto Musk’s critical-path shit list. Musk would hound the person
responsible about the delays but, typically, he would also do everything in his power to help solve
problems. “I was personally holding up the launch once and had to give Elon twice-daily updates
about what was going on,” said Kevin Brogan. “But Elon would say, ‘There are five hundred people
at this company. What do you need?’” One of the calls must have taken place while Musk courted
Riley because Brogan remembered Musk phoning from the bathroom of a London club to find out how
welding had gone on a large part of the rocket. Musk fielded another call in the middle of the night
while sleeping next to Riley and had to whisper as he berated the engineers. “He’s giving us the
pillow talk voice, so we all have to huddle around the speakerphone, while he tells us, ‘You guys
need to get your shit together,’” Brogan said.
With the fourth launch, the demands and anticipation had ratcheted to the point that people started
making silly mistakes. Typically, the body of the Falcon 1 rocket traveled to Kwaj via barge. This
time Musk and the engineers were too excited and desperate to wait for the ocean journey. Musk
rented a military cargo plane to fly the rocket body from Los Angeles to Hawaii and then on to Kwaj.
This would have been a fine idea except the SpaceX engineers forgot to factor in what the pressurized
plane would do to the body of the rocket, which is less than an eighth of an inch thick. As the plane
started its descent into Hawaii, everyone inside of it could hear strange noises coming from the cargo
hold. “I looked back and could see the stage crumpling,” said Bulent Altan, the former head of
avionics at SpaceX. “I told the pilot to go up, and he did.” The rocket had behaved much like an
empty water bottle will on a plane, with the air pressure pushing against the sides of the bottle and
making it buckle. Altan calculated that the SpaceX team on the plane had about thirty minutes to do
something about the problem before they would need to land. They pulled out their pocketknives and
cut away the shrink wrap that held the rocket’s body tight. Then they found a maintenance kit on the
plane and used wrenches to open up some nuts on the rocket that would allow its internal pressure to
match that of the plane’s. When the plane landed, the engineers divvied up the duties of calling
SpaceX’s top executives to tell them about the catastrophe. It was 3 A.M. Los Angeles time, and one of
the executives volunteered to deliver the horrific news to Musk. The thinking at the time was that it
would take three months to repair the damage. The body of the rocket had caved in in several places,
baffles placed inside the fuel tank to stop the sloshing problem had broken, and an assortment of otherissues had appeared. Musk ordered the team to continue on to Kwaj and sent in a reinforcement team
with repair parts. Two weeks later, the rocket had been fixed inside of the makeshift hangar. “It was
like being stuck in a foxhole together,” Altan said. “You weren’t going to quit and leave the person
next to you behind. When it was all done, everyone felt amazing.”
The fourth and possibly final launch for SpaceX took place on September 28, 2008. The SpaceX
employees had worked nonstop shifts under agonizing pressure for six weeks to reach this day. Their
pride as engineers and their hopes and dreams were on the line. “The people watching back at the
factory were trying their best not to throw up,” said James McLaury, a machinist at SpaceX. Despite
their past flubs, the engineers on Kwaj were confident that this launch would work. Some of these
people had spent years on the island going through one of the more surreal engineering exercises in
human history. They had been separated from their families, assaulted by the heat, and exiled on their
tiny launchpad outpost—sometimes without much food—for days on end as they waited for the launch
windows to open and dealt with the aborts that followed. So much of that pain and suffering and fear
would be forgotten if this launch went successfully.
In the late afternoon on the twenty-eighth, the SpaceX team raised the Falcon 1 into its launch
position. Once again, it stood tall, looking like a bizarre artifact of an island tribe as palm trees
swayed beside it and a smattering of clouds crossed through the spectacular blue sky. By this time,
SpaceX had upped its webcast game, turning each launch into a major production both for its
employees and the public. Two SpaceX marketing executives spent twenty minutes before the launch
going through all the technical ins and outs of the launch. The Falcon 1 was not carrying real cargo
this time; neither the company nor the military wanted to see something else blow up or get lost at sea,
so the rocket held a 360-pound dummy payload.
The fact that SpaceX had been reduced to launch theater did not faze the employees or dampen
their enthusiasm. As the rocket rumbled and then climbed higher, the employees back at SpaceX
headquarters let out raucous cheers. Each milestone that followed—clearing the island, engine checks
coming back good—was again met with whistles and shouts. As the first stage fell away, the second
stage fired up about ninety seconds into the flight and the employees turned downright rapturous,
filling the webcast with their ecstatic hollering. “Perfect,” said one of the talking heads. The Kestrel
engine glowed red and started its six-minute burn. “When the second stage cleared, I could finally
start breathing again and my knees stopped buckling,” said McLaury.
The fairing opened up around the three-minute mark and fell back toward Earth. And, finally,
around nine minutes into its journey, the Falcon 1 shut down just as planned and reached orbit, making
it the first privately built machine to accomplish such a feat. It took six years—about four and half
more than Musk had once planned—and five hundred people to make this miracle of modern science
and business happen.
Earlier in the day, Musk had tried to distract himself from the mounting pressure by going to
Disneyland with his brother Kimbal and their children. Musk then had to race back to make the 4 P.M.
launch and walked into SpaceX’s trailer control room about two minutes before blastoff. “When the
launch was successful, everyone burst into tears,” Kimbal said. “It was one of the most emotional
experiences I’ve had.” Musk left the control room and walked out to the factory floor, where he
received a rock star’s welcome. “Well, that was freaking awesome,” he said. “There are a lot of
people who thought we couldn’t do it—a lot actually—but as the saying goes, ‘the fourth time is the
charm,’ right? There are only a handful of countries on Earth that have done this. It’s normally acountry thing, not a company thing. . . . My mind is kind of frazzled, so it’s hard for me to say
anything, but, man, this is definitely one of the greatest days in my life, and I think probably for most
people here. We showed people we can do it. This is just the first step of many. . . . I am going to
have a really great party tonight. I don’t know about you guys.” Mary Beth Brown then tapped Musk
on the shoulder and pulled him away to a meeting.
The afterglow of this mammoth victory faded soon after the party ended, and the severity of
SpaceX’s financial hell became top of mind again for Musk. SpaceX had the Falcon 9 efforts to
support and had also immediately green-lighted the construction of another machine—the Dragon
capsule—that would be used to take supplies, and one day humans, to the International Space Station.
Historically, either project would cost more than $1 billion to complete, but SpaceX would have to
find a way to build both machines simultaneously for a fraction of the cost. The company had
dramatically increased the rate at which it hired employees and moved into a much larger
headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX had a commercial flight booked to carry a satellite
into orbit for the Malaysian government, but that launch and the payment for it would not arrive until
the middle of 2009. In the meantime, SpaceX simply struggled to make its payroll.
The press did not know the extent of Musk’s financial woes, but they knew enough to turn
detailing Tesla’s precarious financial situation into a favored pastime. A website called the Truth
About Cars began a “Tesla Death Watch” in May 2008 and followed up with dozens of entries
throughout the year. The blog took special pleasure in rejecting the idea that Musk was a true founder
of the company, presenting him as the moneyman and chairman who had more or less stolen Tesla
from the genius engineer Eberhard. When Eberhard started a blog detailing the pros and cons of being
a Tesla customer, the auto site was all too happy to echo his gripes. Top Gear, a popular British
television show, ripped the Roadster apart, making it look as if the car had run out of juice during a
road test. “People joke about the Tesla Death Watch and all that, but it was harsh,” said Kimbal Musk.
“One day there were fifty articles about how Tesla will die.”
Then, in October 2008 (just a couple weeks after SpaceX’s successful launch), Valleywag
appeared on the scene again. First it ridiculed Musk for officially taking over as CEO of Tesla and
replacing Drori, on the grounds that Musk had just lucked into his past successes. It followed that by
printing a tell-all e-mail from a Tesla employee. The report said that Tesla had just gone through a
round of layoffs, shut down its Detroit office, and had only $9 million left in the bank. “We have over
1,200 reservations, which manes [sic] we’ve taken multiples of tens of millions of cash from our
customers and have spent them all,” the Tesla employee wrote. “Meanwhile, we only delivered less
than 50 cars. I actually talked a close friend of mine into putting down $60,000 for a Tesla Roadster. I
cannot conscientiously be a bystander anymore and allow my company to deceive the public and
defraud our dear customers. Our customers and the general public are the reason Tesla is so loved.
The fact that they are being lied to is just wrong.”*
Yes, Tesla deserved much of the negative attention. Musk, though, felt like the 2008 climate with
the hatred of bankers and the rich had turned him into a particularly juicy target. “I was just getting
pistol-whipped,” Musk said. “There was a lot of schadenfreude at the time, and it was bad on so
many levels. Justine was torturing me in the press. There were always all these negative articles
about Tesla, and the stories about SpaceX’s third failure. It hurt really bad. You have these huge
doubts that your life is not working, your car is not working, you’re going through a divorce and all of
those things. I felt like a pile of shit. I didn’t think we would overcome it. I thought things wereprobably fucking doomed.”
When Musk ran through the calculations concerning SpaceX and Tesla, it occurred to him that
only one company would likely even have a chance at survival. “I could either pick SpaceX or Tesla
or split the money I had left between them,” Musk said. “That was a tough decision. If I split the
money, maybe both of them would die. If I gave the money to just one company, the probability of it
surviving was greater, but then it would mean certain death for the other company. I debated that over
and over.” While Musk meditated on this, the economy worsened quickly and so too did Musk’s
financial condition. As 2008 came to an end, Musk had run out of money.
Riley began to see Musk’s life as a Shakespearean tragedy. Sometimes Musk would open up to
her about the issues, and other times he retreated into himself. Riley spied on Musk while he read email and watched him grimace as the bad news poured in. “You’d witness him having these
conversations in his head,” she said. “It’s really hard to watch someone you love struggle like that.”
Because of the long hours that he worked and his eating habits, Musk’s weight fluctuated wildly. Bags
formed under his eyes, and his countenance started to resemble that of a shattered runner at the back
end of an ultra-marathon. “He looked like death itself,” Riley said. “I remember thinking this guy
would have a heart attack and die. He seemed like a man on the brink.” In the middle of the night,
Musk would have nightmares and yell out. “He was in physical pain,” Riley said. “He would climb
on me and start screaming while still asleep.” The couple had to start borrowing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from Musk’s friend Skoll, and Riley’s parents offered to remortgage their house.
Musk no longer flew his jet back and forth between Los Angles and Silicon Valley. He took
Southwest.
Burning through about $4 million a month, Tesla needed to close another major round of funding
to get through 2008 and stay alive. Musk had to lean on friends just to try to make payroll from week
to week, as he negotiated with investors. He sent impassioned pleas to anyone he could think of who
might be able to spare some money. Bill Lee invested $2 million in Tesla, and Sergey Brin invested
$500,000. “A bunch of Tesla employees wrote checks to keep the company going,” said Diarmuid
O’Connell, the vice president of business development at Tesla. “They turned into investments, but, at
the time, it was twenty-five or fifty thousand dollars that you didn’t expect to see again. It just seemed
like holy shit, this thing is going to crater.” Kimbal had lost most of his money during the recession
when his investments bottomed out but sold what he had left and put it into Tesla as well. “I was
close to bankruptcy,” Kimbal said. Tesla had set the prepayments that customers made for the
Roadsters aside, but Musk now needed to use that money to keep the company going and soon those
funds were gone, too. These fiscal maneuvers worried Kimbal. “I’m sure Elon would have found a
way to make things right, but he definitely took risks that seemed like they could have landed him in
jail for using someone else’s money,” he said.
In December 2008, Musk mounted simultaneous campaigns to try to save his companies. He heard
a rumor that NASA was on the verge of awarding a contract to resupply the space station. SpaceX’s
fourth launch had put it in a position to receive some of this money, which was said to be in excess of
$1 billion. Musk reached out through some back channels in Washington and found out that SpaceX
might even be a front-runner for the deal. Musk began doing everything in his power to assure people
that the company could meet the challenge of getting a capsule to the ISS. As for Tesla, Musk had to
go to his existing investors and ask them to pony up for another round of funding that needed to close
by Christmas Eve to avoid bankruptcy. To give the investors some measure of confidence, Musk madea last-ditch effort to raise all the personal funds he could and put them into the company. He took out a
loan from SpaceX, which NASA approved, and earmarked the money for Tesla. Musk went to the
secondary markets to try to sell some of his shares in SolarCity. He also seized about $15 million that
came through when Dell acquired a data center software start-up called Everdream, founded by
Musk’s cousins, in which he had invested. “It was like the fucking Matrix,” Musk said, describing his
financial maneuvers. “The Everdream deal really saved my butt.”
Musk had cobbled together $20 million, and asked Tesla’s existing investors—since no new
investors materialized—to match that figure. The investors agreed, and on December 3, 2008, they
were in the process of finalizing the paperwork for the funding round when Musk noticed a problem.
VantagePoint Capital Partners had signed all of the paperwork except for one crucial page. Musk
phoned up Alan Salzman, VantagePoint’s cofounder and managing partner, to ask about the situation.
Salzman informed Musk that the firm had a problem with the investment round because it undervalued
Tesla. “I said, ‘I’ve got an excellent solution then. Take my entire portion of the deal. I had a real hard
time coming up with the money. Based on the cash we have in the bank right now, we will bounce
payroll next week. So unless you’ve got another idea, can you either just participate as much as you’d
like, or allow the round to go through because otherwise we will be bankrupt.’” Salzman balked and
told Musk to come in the following week at 7 A.M. to present to VantagePoint’s top brass. Not having
a week of time to work with, Musk asked to come in the next day, and Salzman refused that offer,
forcing Musk to continue taking on loans. “The only reason he wanted the meeting at his office was
for me to come on bended knee begging for money so he could say, ‘No,’” Musk theorized. “What a
fuckhead.”
VantagePoint declined to speak about this period, but Musk believed that Salzman’s tactics were
part of a mission to bankrupt Tesla. Musk feared that VantagePoint would oust him as CEO,
recapitalize Tesla, and emerge as the major owner of the carmaker. It could then sell Tesla to a
Detroit automaker or focus on selling electric drivetrains and battery packs instead of making cars.
Such reasoning would have been quite practical from a business standpoint but did not match up with
Musk’s goals for Tesla. “VantagePoint was forcing that wisdom down the throat of an entrepreneur
who wanted to do something bigger and bolder,” said Steve Jurvetson, a partner at Draper Fisher
Jurvetson and Tesla investor. “Maybe they’re used to a CEO buckling, but Elon doesn’t do that.”
Instead, Musk took another huge risk. Tesla recharacterized the funding as a debt round rather than an
equity round, knowing that VantagePoint could not interfere with a debt deal. The tricky part of this
strategy was that investors like Jurvetson who wanted to help Tesla were put in a bind because
venture capital firms are not structured to do debt deals, and convincing their backers to alter their
normal rules of engagement for a company that could very well go bankrupt in a matter of days would
be a very tough ask. Knowing this, Musk bluffed. He told the investors that he would take another
loan from SpaceX and fund the entire round—all $40 million—himself. The tactic worked. “When
you have scarcity, it naturally reinforces greed and leads to more interest,” Jurvetson said. “It was
also easier for us to go back to our firms and say, ‘Here is the deal. Go or no go?’” The deal ended up
closing on Christmas Eve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt. Musk had just a few
hundred thousand dollars left and could not have made payroll the next day. Musk ultimately put in
$12 million, and the investment firms put up the rest. As for Salzman, Musk said, “He should be
ashamed of himself.”
At SpaceX, Musk and the company’s top executives had spent most of December in a state of fear.According to reports in the press, SpaceX, the onetime front-runner for the large NASA contract, had
suddenly lost favor with the space agency. Michael Griffin, who had once almost been a cofounder of
SpaceX, was the head of NASA and had turned on Musk. Griffin did not care for Musk’s aggressive
business tactics, seeing him as borderline unethical. Others have suggested that Griffin ended up
being jealous of Musk and SpaceX.* On December 23, 2008, however, SpaceX received a shock.
People inside NASA had backed SpaceX to become a supplier for the ISS. The company received
$1.6 billion as payment for twelve flights to the space station. Staying with Kimbal in Boulder,
Colorado, for the holidays, Musk broke down in tears as the SpaceX and Tesla transactions
processed. “I hadn’t had an opportunity to buy a Christmas present for Talulah or anything,” he said.
“I went running down the fucking street in Boulder, and the only place that was open sold these shitty
trinkets, and they were about to close. The best thing I could find were these plastic monkeys with
coconuts—those ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ monkeys.”
For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk’s friend, the 2008 period told him
everything he would ever need to know about Musk’s character. He saw a man who arrived in the
United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters
and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the ability to work
harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in
2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.”
That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over
other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias
said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term
decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came
away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”9LIFTOFF
THE FALCON 9 HAS BECOME SPACEX’S WORKHORSE. The rocket looks—let’s face it—like
a giant white phallus. It stands 224.4 feet tall, is 12 feet across, and weighs 1.1 million pounds. The
rocket is powered by nine engines arranged in an “octaweb” pattern at its base with one engine in the
center and eight others encircling it. The engines connect to the first stage, or the main body of the
rocket, which bears the blue SpaceX insignia and an American flag. The shorter second stage of the
rocket sits on top of the first and is the one that actually ends up doing things in space. It can be
outfitted with a rounded container for carrying satellites or a capsule capable of transporting humans.
By design, there’s nothing particularly flashy about the Falcon 9’s outward appearance. It’s the
spaceship equivalent of an Apple laptop or a Braun kettle—an elegant, purposeful machine stripped
of frivolity and waste.
SpaceX sometimes uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California to send up these
Falcon 9 rockets. Were it not owned by the military, the base would be a resort. The Pacific Ocean
runs for miles along its border, and its grounds have wide-open shrubby fields dotted by green hills.
Nestled into one hilly spot just at the ocean’s edge are a handful of launchpads. On launch days, the
white Falcon 9 breaks up the blue and green landscape, pointing skyward and leaving no doubt about
its intentions.
About four hours before a launch, the Falcon 9 starts getting filled with an immense amount of
liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene. Some of the liquid oxygen vents out of the rocket as it
awaits launch and is kept so cold that it boils off on contact with the metal and air, forming white
plumes that stream down the rocket’s sides. This gives the impression of the Falcon 9 huffing and
puffing as it limbers up before the journey. The engineers inside of SpaceX’s mission control monitor
these fuel systems and all manner of other items. They chat back and forth through headsets and begin
cycling through their launch checklist, consumed by what people in the business call “go fever” as
they move from one approval to the next. Ten minutes before launch, the humans step out of the way
and leave the remaining processes up to automated machines. Everything goes quiet, and the tension
builds until right before the main event. That’s when, out of nowhere, the Falcon 9 breaks the silence
by letting out a loud gasp.
A white latticed support structure pulls away from its body. The T-minus-ten-seconds countdown
begins. Nothing much happens from ten down to four. At the count of three, however, the engines
ignite, and the computers conduct a last, oh-so-rapid, health check. Four enormous metal clamps hold
the rocket down, as computing systems evaluate all nine engines and measure if there’s sufficient
downward force being produced. By the time zero arrives, the rocket has decided that all is well
enough to go through with its mission, and the clamps release. The rocket goes to war with inertia,
and then, with flames surrounding its base and snow-thick plumes of the liquid oxygen filling the air,
it shoots up. Seeing something so large hold so straight and steady while suspended in midair is hard
for the brain to register. It is foreign, inexplicable. About twenty seconds after liftoff, the spectators
placed safely a few miles away catch the first faceful of the Falcon 9’s rumble. It’s a distinct sound—a sort of staccato crackling that arises from chemicals whipped into a violent frenzy. Pant legs vibrate
from shock waves produced by a stream of sonic booms coming out of the Falcon 9’s exhaust. The
white rocket climbs higher and higher with impressive stamina. After about a minute, it’s just a red
spot in the sky, and then—poof—it’s gone. Only a cynical dullard could come away from witnessing
this feeling anything other than wonder at what man can accomplish.
For Elon Musk, this spectacle has turned into a familiar experience. SpaceX has metamorphosed
from the joke of the aeronautics industry into one of its most consistent operators. SpaceX sends a
rocket up about once a month, carrying satellites for companies and nations and supplies to the
International Space Station. Where the Falcon 1 blasting off from Kwajalein was the work of a startup, the Falcon 9 taking off from Vandenberg is the work of an aerospace superpower. SpaceX can
undercut its U.S. competitors—Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences—on price by a ridiculous
margin. It also offers U.S. customers a peace of mind that its rivals can’t. Where these competitors
rely on Russian and other foreign suppliers, SpaceX makes all of its machines from scratch in the
United States. Because of its low costs, SpaceX has once again made the United States a player in the
worldwide commercial launch market. Its $60 million per launch cost is much less than what Europe
and Japan charge and trumps even the relative bargains offered by the Russians and Chinese, who
have the added benefit of decades of sunk government investment into their space programs as well as
cheap labor.
The United States continues to take great pride in having Boeing compete against Airbus and other
foreign aircraft makers. For some reason, though, government leaders and the public have been
willing to concede much of the commercial launch market. It’s a disheartening and shortsighted
position. The total market for satellites, related services, and the rocket launches needed to carry
them to space has exploded over the past decade from about $60 billion per year to more than $200
billion.11 A number of countries pay to send up their own spy, communication, and weather satellites.
Companies then turn to space for television, Internet, radio, weather, navigation, and imaging
services. The machines in space supply the fabric of modern life, and they’re going to become more
capable and interesting at a rapid pace. A whole new breed of satellite makers has just appeared on
the scene with the ability to answer Google-like queries about our planet. These satellites can zoom
in on Iowa and determine when cornfields are at peak yields and ready to harvest, and they can count
cars in Wal-Mart parking lots throughout California to calculate shopping demand during the holiday
season. The start-ups making these types of innovative machines must often turn to the Russians to get
them into space, but SpaceX intends to change that.
The United States has remained competitive in the most lucrative parts of the space industry,
building the actual satellites and complementary systems and services to run them. Each year, the
United States makes about one-third of all satellites and takes about 60 percent of the global satellite
revenue. The majority of this revenue comes from business done with the U.S. government. China,
Europe, and Russia account for almost all of the remaining satellite sales and launches. It’s expected
that China’s role in the space industry will increase, while Russia has vowed to spend $50 billion on
revitalizing its space program. This leaves the United States dealing with two of its least-favored
nations in space matters and doing so without much leverage. Case in point: the retirement of the
space shuttle made the United States totally dependent on the Russians to get astronauts to the ISS.
Russia gets to charge $70 million per person for the trip and to cut the United States off as it sees fit
during political rifts. At present, SpaceX looks like the best hope of breaking this cycle and givingback to America its ability to take people into space.
SpaceX has become the free radical trying to upend everything about this industry. It doesn’t want
to handle a few launches per year or to rely on government contracts for survival. Musk’s goal is to
use manufacturing breakthroughs and launchpad advances to create a drastic drop in the cost of getting
things to space. Most significant, he’s been testing rockets that can push their payload to space and
then return to Earth and land with supreme accuracy on a pad floating at sea or even their original
launchpad. Instead of having its rockets break apart after crashing into the sea, SpaceX will use
reverse thrusters to lower them down softly and reuse them. Within the next few years, SpaceX
expects to cut its price to at least one-tenth that of its rivals. Reusing its rockets will drive the bulk of
this reduction and SpaceX’s competitive advantage. Imagine one airline that flies the same plane over
and over again, competing against others that dispose of their planes after every flight.* Through its
cost advantages, SpaceX hopes to take over the majority of the world’s commercial launches, and
there’s evidence that the company is on its way toward doing just that. To date, it has flown satellites
for Canadian, European, and Asian customers and completed about two dozen launches. Its public
launch manifest stretches out for a number of years, and SpaceX has more than fifty flights planned,
which are all together worth more than $5 billion. The company remains privately owned with Musk
as the largest shareholder alongside outside investors including venture capital firms like the
Founders Fund and Draper Fisher Jurvetson, giving it a competitive ethos its rivals lack. Since getting
past its near-death experience in 2008, SpaceX has been profitable and is estimated to be worth $12
billion.
Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, SolarCity—they are all expressions of Musk. SpaceX is Musk. Its foibles
emanate directly from him, as do its successes. Part of this comes from Musk’s maniacal attention to
detail and involvement in every SpaceX endeavor. He’s hands-on to a degree that would make Hugh
Hefner feel inadequate. Part of it stems from SpaceX being the apotheosis of the Cult of Musk.
Employees fear Musk. They adore Musk. The give up their lives for Musk, and they usually do all of
this simultaneously.
Musk’s demanding management style can only flourish because of the otherworldly—in a literal
sense—aspirations of the company. While the rest of the aerospace industry has been content to keep
sending what look like relics from the 1960s into space, SpaceX has made a point of doing just the
opposite. Its reusable rockets and reusable spaceships look like true twenty-first-century machines.
The modernization of the equipment is not just for show. It reflects SpaceX’s constant push to advance
its technology and change the economics of the industry. Musk does not simply want to lower the cost
of deploying satellites and resupplying the space station. He wants to lower the cost of launches to the
point that it becomes economical and practical to fly thousands upon thousands of supply trips to
Mars and start a colony. Musk wants to conquer the solar system, and, as it stands, there’s just one
company where you can work if that sort of quest gets you out of bed in the morning.
It seems unfathomable, but the rest of the space industry has made space boring. The Russians,
who dominate much of the business of sending things and people to space, do so with decades-old
equipment. The cramped Soyuz capsule that takes people to the space station has mechanical knobs
and computer screens that appear unchanged from its inaugural 1966 flight. Countries new to the
space race have mimicked the antiquated Russian and American equipment with maddening accuracy.
When young people get into the aerospace industry, they’re forced to either laugh or cry at the state of
the machines. Nothing sucks the fun out of working on a spaceship like controlling it with mechanismslast seen in a 1960s laundromat. And the actual work environment is as outmoded as the machines.
Hotshot college graduates have historically been forced to pick between a variety of slow-moving
military contractors and interesting but ineffectual start-ups.
Musk has managed to take these negatives surrounding the aerospace business and turn them into
gains for SpaceX. He’s presented the company as anything but another aerospace contractor. SpaceX
is the hip, forward-thinking place that’s brought the perks of Silicon Valley—namely frozen yogurt,
stock options, speedy decision making, and a flat corporate structure—to a staid industry. People who
know Musk well tend to describe him more as a general than a CEO, and this is apt. He’s built an
engineering army by having the pick of just about anyone in the business that SpaceX wants.
The SpaceX hiring model places some emphasis on getting top marks at top schools. But most of
the attention goes toward spotting engineers who have exhibited type A personality traits over the
course of their lives. The company’s recruiters look for people who might excel at robot-building
competitions or who are car-racing hobbyists who have built unusual vehicles. The object is to find
individuals who ooze passion, can work well as part of a team, and have real-world experience
bending metal. “Even if you’re someone who writes code for your job, you need to understand how
mechanical things work,” said Dolly Singh, who spent five years as the head of talent acquisition at
SpaceX. “We were looking for people that had been building things since they were little.”
Sometimes these people walked through the front door. Other times, Singh relied on a handful of
enterprising techniques to find them. She became famous for trawling through academic papers to find
engineers with very specific skills, cold-calling researchers at labs and plucking possessed engineers
out of college. At trade shows and conferences, SpaceX recruiters wooed interesting candidates they
had spotted with a cloak-and-dagger shtick. They would hand out blank envelopes that contained
invitations to meet at a specific time and place, usually a bar or restaurant near the event, for an initial
interview. The candidates that showed up would discover they were among only a handful of people
who been anointed out of all the conference attendees. They were immediately made to feel special
and inspired.
Like many tech companies, SpaceX subjects potential hires to a gauntlet of interviews and tests.
Some of the interviews are easygoing chats in which both parties get to feel each other out; others are
filled with quizzes that can be quite hard. Engineers tend to face the most rigorous interrogations,
although business types and salesmen are made to suffer, too. Coders who expect to pass through
standard challenges have rude awakenings. Companies will typically challenge software developers
on the spot by asking them to solve problems that require a couple of dozen lines of code. The
standard SpaceX problem requires five hundred or more lines of code. All potential employees who
make their way to the end of the interview process then handle one more task. They’re asked to write
an essay for Musk about why they want to work at SpaceX.
The reward for solving the puzzles, acting clever in interviews, and penning up a good essay is a
meeting with Musk. He interviewed almost every one of SpaceX’s first one thousand hires, including
the janitors and technicians, and has continued to interview the engineers as the company’s workforce
swelled. Each employee receives a warning before going to meet with Musk. The interview, he or she
is told, could last anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes. Elon will likely keep on writing emails and working during the initial part of the interview and not speak much. Don’t panic. That’s
normal. Eventually, he will turn around in his chair to face you. Even then, though, he might not
make actual eye contact with you or fully acknowledge your presence. Don’t panic. That’s normal.In due course, he will speak to you. From that point, the tales of engineers who have interviewed
with Musk run the gamut from torturous experiences to the sublime. He might ask one question or he
might ask several. You can be sure, though, that he will roll out the Riddle: “You’re standing on the
surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly
where you started. Where are you?” One answer to that is the North Pole, and most of the engineers
get it right away. That’s when Musk will follow with “Where else could you be?” The other answer
is somewhere close to the South Pole where, if you walk one mile south, the circumference of the
Earth becomes one mile. Fewer engineers get this answer, and Musk will happily walk them through
that riddle and others and cite any relevant equations during his explanations. He tends to care less
about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their
approach to solving it.
When speaking to potential recruits, Singh tried to energize them and be up front about the
demands of SpaceX and of Musk at the same time. “The recruiting pitch was SpaceX is special
forces,” she said. “If you want as hard as it gets, then great. If not, then you shouldn’t come here.”
Once at SpaceX, the new employees found out very quickly if they were indeed up for the challenge.
Many of them would quit within the first few months because of the ninety-plus-hour workweeks.
Others quit because they could not handle just how direct Musk and the other executives were during
meetings. “Elon doesn’t know about you and he hasn’t thought through whether or not something is
going to hurt your feelings,” Singh said. “He just knows what the fuck he wants done. People who did
not normalize to his communication style did not do well.”
There’s an impression that SpaceX suffers from incredibly high turnover, and the company has
without question churned through a fair number of bodies. Many of the key executives who helped
start the company, however, have hung on for a decade or more. Among the rank-and-file engineers,
most people stay on for at least five years to have their stock options vest and to see their projects
through. This is typical behavior for any technology company. SpaceX and Musk also seem to inspire
an unusual level of loyalty. Musk has managed to conjure up that Steve Jobs–like zeal among his
troops. “His vision is so clear,” Singh said. “He almost hypnotizes you. He gives you the crazy eye,
and it’s like, yes, we can get to Mars.” Take that a bit further and you arrive at a pleasure-pain,
sadomasochistic vibe that comes with working for Musk. Numerous people interviewed for this book
decried the work hours, Musk’s blunt style, and his sometimes ludicrous expectations. Yet almost
every person—even those who had been fired—still worshipped Musk and talked about him in terms
usually reserved for superheroes or deities.
SpaceX’s original headquarters in El Segundo were not quite up to the company’s desired image
as a place where the cool kids want to work. This is not a problem for SpaceX’s new facility in
Hawthorne. The building’s address is 1 Rocket Road, and it has the Hawthorne Municipal Airport
and several tooling and manufacturing companies as neighbors. While the SpaceX building resembles
the others in size and shape, its all-white color makes it the obvious outlier. The structure looks like a
gargantuan, rectangular glacier that’s been planted in the midst of a particularly soulless portion of
Los Angeles County’s sprawl.
Visitors to SpaceX have to walk past a security guard and through a small executive parking lot
where Musk parks his black Model S, which flanks the building’s entryway. The front doors are
reflective and hide what’s on the inside, which is more white. There are white walls in the foyer, a
funky white table in the waiting area, and a white check-in desk with a pair of orchids sitting in whitepots. After going through the registration process, guests are given a name badge and led into the main
SpaceX office space. Musk’s cubicle—a supersize unit—sits to the right where he has a couple of
celebratory Aviation Week magazine covers up on the wall, pictures of his boys, next to a huge flatscreen monitor, and various knickknacks on his desk, including a boomerang, some books, a bottle of
wine, and a giant samurai sword named Lady Vivamus, which Musk received when he won the
Heinlein Prize, an award given for big achievements in commercial space. Hundreds of other people
work in cubicles amid the big, wide-open area, most of them executives, engineers, software
developers, and salespeople tapping away on their computers. The conference rooms that surround
their desks all have space-themed names like Apollo or Wernher von Braun and little nameplates that
explain the label’s significance. The largest conference rooms have ultramodern chairs—highbacked, sleek red jobs that surround large glass tables—while panoramic photos of a Falcon 1 taking
off from Kwaj or the Dragon capsule docking with the ISS hang on the walls in the background.
Take away the rocket swag and the samurai sword and this central part of the SpaceX office looks
just like what you might find at your run-of-the-mill Silicon Valley headquarters. The same thing
cannot be said for what visitors encounter as they pass through a pair of double doors into the heart of
the SpaceX factory.
The 550,000-square-foot factory floor is difficult to process at first glance. It’s one continuous
space with grayish epoxied floors, white walls, and white support columns. A small city’s worth of
stuff—people, machines, noise—has been piled into this area. Just near the entryway, one of the
Dragon capsules that has gone to the ISS and returned to Earth hangs from the ceiling with black burn
marks running down its side. Just under the capsule on the ground are a pair of the twenty-five-footlong landing legs built by SpaceX to let the Falcon rocket come to a gentle rest on the ground after a
flight so it can be flown again. To the left side of this entryway area there’s a kitchen, and to the right
side there’s the mission control room. It’s a closed-off area with expansive glass windows and
fronted by wall-size screens for tracking a rocket’s progress. It has four rows of desks with about ten
computers each for the mission control staff. Step a bit farther into the factory and there are a handful
of industrial work areas separated from each other in the most informal of ways. In some spots there
are blue lines on the floor to mark off an area and in other spots blue workbenches have been
arranged in squares to cordon off the space. It’s a common sight to have one of the Merlin engines
raised up in the middle of one of these work areas with a half dozen technicians wiring it up and
tuning its bits and pieces.
Just behind these workspaces is a glass-enclosed square big enough to fit two of the Dragon
capsules. This is a clean room where people must wear lab coats and hairnets to fiddle with the
capsules without contaminating them. About forty feet to the left, there are several Falcon 9 rockets
lying next to each other horizontally that have been painted and await transport. There are some areas
tucked in between all of this that have blue walls and appear to have been covered by fabric. These
are top-secret zones where SpaceX might be working on a fanciful astronaut’s outfit or rocket part
that it has to hide from visitors and employees not tied to the projects. There’s a large area off to the
side where SpaceX builds all of its electronics, another area for creating specialized composite
materials, and another for making the bus-sized fairings that wrap around the satellites. Hundreds of
people move about at the same time through the factory—a mix of gritty technicians with tattoos and
bandanas, and young, white-collar engineers. The sweaty smell of kids who have just come off the
playground permeates the building and hints at its nonstop activity.Musk has left his personal touches throughout the factory. There are small things like the data
center that has been bathed in blue lights to give it a sci-fi feel. The refrigerator-sized computers
under the lights have been labeled with big block letters to make it look like they were made by
Cyberdyne Systems, the fictional company from the Terminator movie franchise. Near the elevators,
Musk has placed a glowing life-size Iron Man figure. Surely the factory’s most Muskian element is the
office space that has been built smack-dab in its center. This is a three-story glass structure with
meeting rooms and desks that rises up between various welding and construction areas. It looks and
feels bizarre to have a see-through office inside this hive of industry. Musk, though, wanted his
engineers to watch what was going on with the machines at all times and to make sure they had to
walk through the factory and talk to the technicians on the way to their desks.
The factory is a temple devoted to what SpaceX sees as its major weapon in the rocket-building
game, in-house manufacturing. SpaceX manufactures between 80 percent and 90 percent of its
rockets, engines, electronics, and other parts. It’s a strategy that flat-out dumbfounds SpaceX’s
competitors, like United Launch Alliance, or ULA, which openly brags about depending on more than
1,200 suppliers to make its end products. (ULA, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing,
sees itself as an engine of job creation rather than a model of inefficiency.)
A typical aerospace company comes up with the list of parts that it needs for a launch system and
then hands off their design and specifications to myriad third parties who then actually build the
hardware. SpaceX tends to buy as little as possible to save money and because it sees depending on
suppliers—especially foreign ones—as a weakness. This approach comes off as excessive at first
blush. Companies have made things like radios and power distribution units for decades. Reinventing
the wheel for every computer and machine on a rocket could introduce more chances for error and, in
general, be a waste of time. But for SpaceX, the strategy works. In addition to building its own
engines, rocket bodies, and capsules, SpaceX designs its own motherboards and circuits, sensors to
detect vibrations, flight computers, and solar panels. Just by streamlining a radio, for instance,
SpaceX’s engineers have found that they can reduce the weight of the device by about 20 percent. And
the cost savings for a homemade radio are dramatic, dropping from between $50,000 to $100,000 for
the industrial-grade equipment used by aerospace companies to $5,000 for SpaceX’s unit.
It’s hard to believe these kinds of price differentials at first, but there are dozens if not hundreds
of places where SpaceX has secured such savings. The equipment at SpaceX tends to be built out of
readily available consumer electronics as opposed to “space grade” equipment used by others in the
industry. SpaceX has had to work for years to prove to NASA that standard electronics have gotten
good enough to compete with the more expensive, specialized gear trusted in years past. “Traditional
aerospace has been doing things the same way for a very, very long time,” said Drew Eldeen, a
former SpaceX engineer. “The biggest challenge was convincing NASA to give something new a try
and building a paper trail that showed the parts were high enough quality.” To prove that it’s making
the right choice to NASA and itself, SpaceX will sometimes load a rocket with both the standard
equipment and prototypes of its own design for testing during flight. Engineers then compare the
performance characteristics of the devices. Once a SpaceX design equals or outperforms the
commercial products, it becomes the de facto hardware.
There have also been numerous times when SpaceX has done pioneering work on advancing very
complex hardware systems. A classic example of this is one of the factory’s weirder-looking
contraptions, a two-story machine designed to perform what’s known as friction stir welding. Themachine allows SpaceX to automate the welding process for massive sheets of metal like the ones
that make up the bodies of the Falcon rockets. An arm takes one of the rocket’s body panels, lines it
up against another body panel, and then joins them together with a weld that could run twenty feet or
more. Aerospace companies typically try to avoid welds whenever possible because they create
weaknesses in the metal, and that’s limited the size of metal sheets they can use and forced other
design constraints. From the early days of SpaceX, Musk pushed the company to master friction stir
welding, in which a spinning head is smashed at high speeds into the join between two pieces of
metal in a bid to make their crystalline structures merge. It’s as if you heated two sheets of aluminum
foil and then joined them by putting your thumb down on the seam and twisting the metal together.
This type of welding tends to result in much stronger bonds than traditional welds. Companies had
performed friction stir welding before but not on structures as large as a rocket’s body or to the
degree to which SpaceX has used the technique. As a result of its trials and errors, SpaceX can now
join large, thin sheets of metal and shave hundreds of pounds off the weight of the Falcon rockets, as
it’s able to use lighter-weight alloys and avoid using rivets, fasteners, and other support structures.
Musk’s competitors in the auto industry might soon need to do the same because SpaceX has
transferred some of the equipment and techniques to Tesla. The hope is that Tesla will be able to
make lighter, stronger cars.
The technology has proven so valuable that SpaceX’s competitors have started to copy it and have
tried to poach some of the company’s experts in the field. Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s secretive rocket
company, has been particularly aggressive, hiring away Ray Miryekta, one of the world’s foremost
friction stir welding experts and igniting a major rift with Musk. “Blue Origin does these surgical
strikes on specialized talent* offering like double their salaries. I think it’s unnecessary and a bit
rude,” Musk said. Within SpaceX, Blue Origin is mockingly referred to as BO and at one point the
company created an e-mail filter to detect messages with “blue” and “origin” to block the poaching.
The relationship between Musk and Bezos has soured, and they no longer chat about their shared
ambition of getting to Mars. “I do think Bezos has an insatiable desire to be King Bezos,” Musk said.
“He has a relentless work ethic and wants to kill everything in e-commerce. But he’s not the most fun
guy, honestly.”*
In the early days of SpaceX, Musk knew little about the machines and amount of grunt work that
goes into making rockets. He rebuffed requests to buy specialized tooling equipment, until the
engineers could explain in clear terms why they needed certain things and until experience taught him
better. Musk also had yet to master some of the management techniques for which he would become
both famous and to some degree infamous.
Musk’s growth as a CEO and rocket expert occurred alongside SpaceX’s maturation as a
company. At the start of the Falcon 1 journey, Musk was a forceful software executive trying to learn
some basic things about a very different world. At Zip2 and PayPal, he felt comfortable standing up
for his positions and directing teams of coders. At SpaceX, he had to pick things up on the job. Musk
initially relied on textbooks to form the bulk of his rocketry knowledge. But as SpaceX hired one
brilliant person after another, Musk realized he could tap into their stores of knowledge. He would
trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or
specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said
Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would
quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” People who have spent significant timewith Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless
recall. It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the
present day as it did when he was a child vacuuming books into his brain. After a couple of years
running SpaceX, Musk had turned into an aerospace expert on a level that few technology CEOs ever
approach in their respective fields. “He was teaching us about the value of time, and we were
teaching him about rocketry,” Brogan said.
In regards to time, Musk may well set more aggressive delivery targets for very difficult-to-make
products than any executive in history. Both his employees and the public have found this to be one of
the more jarring aspects of Musk’s character. “Elon has always been optimistic,” Brogan said.
“That’s the nice word. He can be a downright liar about when things need to get done. He will pick
the most aggressive time schedule imaginable assuming everything goes right, and then accelerate it
by assuming that everyone can work harder.”
Musk has been pilloried by the press for setting and then missing product delivery dates. It’s one
of the habits that got him in the most trouble as SpaceX and Tesla tried to bring their first products to
market. Time and again, Musk found himself making a public appearance where he had to come up
with a new batch of excuses for a delay. Reminded about the initial 2003 target date to fly the Falcon
1, Musk acted shocked. “Are you serious?” he said. “We said that? Okay, that’s ridiculous. I think I
just didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. The only thing I had prior experience in was
software, and, yeah, you can write a bunch of software and launch a website in a year. No problem.
This isn’t like software. It doesn’t work that way with rockets.” Musk simply cannot help himself.
He’s an optimist by nature, and it can feel like he makes calculations for how long it will take to do
something based on the idea that things will progress without flaw at every step and that all the
members of his team have Muskian abilities and work ethics. As Brogan joked, Musk might forecast
how long a software project will take by timing the amount of seconds needed physically to write a
line of code and then extrapolating that out to match however many lines of code he expects the final
piece of software to be. It’s an imperfect analogy but one that does not seem that far off from Musk’s
worldview. “Everything he does is fast,” Brogan said. “He pees fast. It’s like a fire hose—three
seconds and out. He’s authentically in a hurry.”
Asked about his approach, Musk said,
I certainly don’t try to set impossible goals. I think impossible goals are demotivating.
You don’t want to tell people to go through a wall by banging their head against it. I don’t
ever set intentionally impossible goals. But I’ve certainly always been optimistic on time
frames. I’m trying to recalibrate to be a little more realistic.
I don’t assume that it’s just like 100 of me or something like that. I mean, in the case of
the early SpaceX days, it would have been just the lack of understanding of what it takes to
develop a rocket. In that case I was off by, say, 200 percent. I think future programs might
be off by anywhere from like 25 percent to 50 percent as opposed to 200 percent.
So, I think generally you do want to have a timeline where, based on everything you
know about, the schedule should be X, and you execute towards that, but with the
understanding that there will be all sorts of things that you don’t know about that you will
encounter that will push the date beyond that. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have tried
to aim for that date from the beginning because aiming for something else would have beenan arbitrary time increase.
It’s different to say, “Well, what do you promise people?” Because you want to try to
promise people something that includes schedule margin. But in order to achieve the
external promised schedule, you’ve got to have an internal schedule that’s more aggressive
than that. Sometimes you still miss the external schedule.
SpaceX, by the way, is not alone here. Being late is par for the course in the aerospace
industry. It’s not a question of if it’s late, it’s how late will the program be. I don’t think an
aerospace program has been completed on time since bloody World War II.
Dealing with the epically aggressive schedules and Musk’s expectations has required SpaceX’s
engineers to develop a variety of survival techniques. Musk often asks for highly detailed proposals
for how projects will be accomplished. The employees have learned never to break the time needed
to accomplish something down into months or weeks. Musk wants day-by-day and hour-by-hour
forecasts and sometimes even minute-by-minute countdowns, and the fallout from missed schedules is
severe. “You had to put in when you would go to the bathroom,” Brogan said. “I’m like, ‘Elon,
sometimes people need to take a long dump.’” SpaceX’s top managers work together to, in essence,
create fake schedules that they know will please Musk but that are basically impossible to achieve.
This would not be such a horrible situation if the targets were kept internal. Musk, however, tends to
quote these fake schedules to customers, unintentionally giving them false hope. Typically, it falls to
Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president, to clean up the resulting mess. She will either need to ring up
a customer to give them a more realistic timeline or concoct a litany of excuses to explain away the
inevitable delays. “Poor Gwynne,” Brogan said. “Just to hear her on the phone with the customers is
agonizing.”
There can be no question that Musk has mastered the art of getting the most out of his employees.
Interview three dozen SpaceX engineers and each one of them will have picked up on a managerial
nuance that Musk has used to get people to meet his deadlines. One example from Brogan: Where a
typical manager may set the deadline for the employee, Musk guides his engineers into taking
ownership of their own delivery dates. “He doesn’t say, ‘You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.,’”
Brogan said. “He says, ‘I need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?’ Then, when
you say yes, you are not working hard because he told you to. You’re working hard for yourself. It’s a
distinction you can feel. You have signed up to do your own work.” And by recruiting hundreds of
bright, self-motivated people, SpaceX has maximized the power of the individual. One person putting
in a sixteen-hour day ends up being much more effective than two people working eight-hour days
together. The individual doesn’t have to hold meetings, reach a consensus, or bring other people up to
speed on a project. He just keeps working and working and working. The ideal SpaceX employee is
someone like Steve Davis, the director of advanced projects at SpaceX. “He’s been working sixteen
hours a day every day for years,” Brogan said. “He gets more done than eleven people working
together.”
To find Davis, Musk called a teaching assistant* in Stanford’s aeronautics department and asked
him if there were any hardworking, bright master’s and doctoral candidates who didn’t have families.
The TA pointed Musk to Davis, who was pursuing a master’s degree in aerospace engineering to add
to degrees in finance, mechanical engineering, and particle physics. Musk called Davis on a
Wednesday and offered him a job the following Friday. Davis was the twenty-second SpaceX hireand has ended up the twelfth most senior person still at the company. He turned thirty-five in 2014.
Davis did his tour of duty on Kwaj and considered it the greatest time of his life. “Every night,
you could either sleep by the rocket in this tent shelter where the geckos crawled all over you or take
this one-hour boat ride that made you seasick back to the main island,” he said. “Every night, you had
to pick the pain that you remembered least. You got so hot and exhausted. It was just amazing.” After
working on the Falcon 1, Davis moved to the Falcon 9 and then Dragon.
The Dragon capsule took SpaceX four years to design. It’s likely the fastest project of its ilk done
in the history of the aerospace industry. The project started with Musk and a handful of engineers,
most of them under thirty years old, and peaked at one hundred people.* They cribbed from past
capsule work and read over every paper published by NASA and other aeronautics bodies around
projects like Gemini and Apollo. “If you go search for something like Apollo’s reentry guidance
algorithm, there are these great databases that will just spit out the answer,” Davis said. The
engineers at SpaceX then had to figure out how to advance these past efforts and bring the capsule
into the modern age. Some of the areas of improvement were obvious and easily accomplished, while
others required more ingenuity. Saturn 5 and Apollo had colossal computing bays that produced only
a fraction of the computer horsepower that can be achieved today on, say, an iPad. The SpaceX
engineers knew they could save a lot of room by cutting out some of the computers while also adding
capabilities with their more powerful equipment. The engineers decided that while Dragon would
look a lot like Apollo, it would have steeper wall angles, to clear space for gear and for the
astronauts that the company hoped to fly. SpaceX also got the recipe for its heat shield material,
called PICA, through a deal with NASA. The SpaceX engineers found out how to make the PICA
material less expensively and improved the underlying recipe so that Dragon—from day one—could
withstand the heat of a reentry coming back from Mars.* The total cost for Dragon came in at $300
million, which would be on the order of 10 to 30 times less than capsule projects built by other
companies. “The metal comes in, we roll it out, weld it, and make things,” Davis said. “We build
almost everything in-house. That is why the costs have come down.”
Davis, like Brogan and plenty of other SpaceX engineers, has had Musk ask for the seemingly
impossible. His favorite request dates back to 2004. SpaceX needed an actuator that would trigger
the gimbal action used to steer the upper stage of Falcon 1. Davis had never built a piece of hardware
before in his life and naturally went out to find some suppliers who could make an electromechanical
actuator for him. He got a quote back for $120,000. “Elon laughed,” Davis said. “He said, ‘That part
is no more complicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand dollars. Go make it
work.’” Davis spent nine months building the actuator. At the end of the process, he toiled for three
hours writing an e-mail to Musk covering the pros and cons of the device. The e-mail went into gory
detail about how Davis had designed the part, why he had made various choices, and what its cost
would be. As he pressed send, Davis felt anxiety surge through his body knowing that he’d given his
all for almost a year to do something an engineer at another aerospace company would not even
attempt. Musk rewarded all of this toil and angst with one of his standard responses. He wrote back,
“Ok.” The actuator Davis designed ended up costing $3,900 and flew with Falcon 1 into space. “I put
every ounce of intellectual capital I had into that e-mail and one minute later got that simple
response,” Davis said. “Everyone in the company was having that same experience. One of my
favorite things about Elon is his ability to make enormous decisions very quickly. That is still how it
works today.”Kevin Watson can attest to that. He arrived at SpaceX in 2008 after spending twenty-four years at
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Watson worked on a wide variety of projects at JPL, including
building and testing computing systems that could withstand the harsh conditions of space. JPL would
typically buy expensive, specially toughened computers, and this frustrated Watson. He daydreamed
about ways to handcraft much cheaper, equally effective computers. While having his job interview
with Musk, Watson learned that SpaceX needed just this type of thinking. Musk wanted the bulk of a
rocket’s computing systems to cost no more than $10,000. It was an insane figure by aerospace
industry standards, where the avionics systems for a rocket typically cost well over $10 million. “In
traditional aerospace, it would cost you more than ten thousand dollars just for the food at a meeting
to discuss the cost of the avionics,” Watson said.
During the job interview, Watson promised Musk that he could do the improbable and deliver the
$10,000 avionics system. He began working on making the computers for Dragon right after being
hired. The first system was called CUCU, pronounced “cuckoo.” This communications box would go
inside the International Space Station and communicate back with Dragon. A number of people at
NASA referred to the SpaceX engineers as “the guys in the garage” and were cynical about the startup’s ability to do much of anything, including building this type of machine. But SpaceX produced the
communication computer in record time, and it ended up as the first system of its kind to pass NASA’s
protocol tests on the first try. NASA officials were forced to say “cuckoo” over and over again during
meetings—a small act of defiance SpaceX had planned all along to torture NASA. As the months
went on, Watson and other engineers built out the complete computing systems for Dragon and then
adapted the technology for Falcon 9. The result was a fully redundant avionics platform that used a
mix of off-the-shelf computing gear and products built in-house by SpaceX. It cost a bit more than
$10,000 but came close to meeting Musk’s goal.
SpaceX reinvigorated Watson, who had become disenchanted with JPL’s acceptance of wasteful
spending and bureaucracy. Musk had to sign off on every expenditure over $10,000. “It was his
money that we were spending, and he was keeping an eye on it, as he damn well should,” Watson
said. “He made sure nothing stupid was happening.” Decisions were made quickly during weekly
meetings, and the entire company bought into them. “It was amazing how fast people would adapt to
what came out of those meetings,” Watson said. “The entire ship could turn ninety degrees instantly.
Lockheed Martin could never do anything like that.” Watson continued:
Elon is brilliant. He’s involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he
asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction. He wants
answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really
well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have
seen him do in his head is crazy. He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and
whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all
these equations in real time. It’s amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has
accumulated over the years. I don’t want to be the person who ever has to compete with
Elon. You might as well leave the business and find something else fun to do. He will
outmaneuver you, outthink you, and out-execute you.
One of Watson’s top discoveries at SpaceX was the test bed on the third floor of the Hawthornefactory. SpaceX has test versions of all the hardware and electronics that go into a rocket laid out on
metal tables. It has in effect replicated the innards of a rocket end to end in order to run thousands of
flight simulations. Someone “launches” the rocket from a computer and then every piece of
mechanical and computing hardware is monitored with sensors. An engineer can tell a valve to open,
then check to see if it opened, how quickly it opened, and the level of current running to it. This
testing apparatus lets SpaceX engineers practice ahead of launches and figure out how they would
deal with all manner of anomalies. During the actual flights, SpaceX has people in the test facility
who can replicate errors seen on Falcon or Dragon and make adjustments accordingly. SpaceX has
made numerous changes on the fly with this system. In one case someone spotted an error in a
software file in the hours right before a launch. SpaceX’s engineers changed the file, checked how it
affected the test hardware, and, when no problems were detected, sent the file to the Falcon 9,
waiting on the launchpad, all in less than thirty minutes. “NASA wasn’t used to this,” Watson said. “If
something went wrong with the shuttle, everyone was just resigned to waiting three weeks before they
could try and launch again.”12
From time to time, Musk will send out an e-mail to the entire company to enforce a new policy or
let them know about something that’s bothering him. One of the more famous e-mails arrived in May
2010 with the subject line: Acronyms Seriously Suck:
There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up
acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as
we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem
so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge
glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these
acronyms and people don’t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance.
This is particularly tough on new employees.
That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action—I have given enough
warnings over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX
glossary. If there is an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be
eliminated, as I have requested in the past.
For example, there should be no “HTS” [horizontal test stand] or “VTS” [vertical test
stand] designations for test stands. Those are particularly dumb, as they contain unnecessary
words. A “stand” at our test site is obviously a *test* stand. VTS-3 is four syllables compared
with “Tripod,” which is two, so the bloody acronym version actually takes longer to say than
the name!
The key test for an acronym is to ask whether it helps or hurts communication. An acronym
that most engineers outside of SpaceX already know, such as GUI, is fine to use. It is also ok
to make up a few acronyms/contractions every now and again, assuming I have approved
them, eg MVac and M9 instead of Merlin 1C-Vacuum or Merlin 1C-Sea Level, but those need
to be kept to a minimum.
This was classic Musk. The e-mail is rough in its tone and yet not really unwarranted for a guy
who just wants things done as efficiently as possible. It obsesses over something that other people
might find trivial and yet he has a definite point. It’s comical in that Musk wants all acronymapprovals to run directly through him, but that’s entirely in keeping with the hands-on management
style that has, mainly, worked well at both SpaceX and Tesla. Employees have since dubbed the
acronym policy the ASS Rule.
The guiding principle at SpaceX is to embrace your work and get stuff done. People who await
guidance or detailed instructions languish. The same goes for workers who crave feedback. And the
absolute worst thing that someone can do is inform Musk that what he’s asking is impossible. An
employee could be telling Musk that there’s no way to get the cost on something like that actuator
down to where he wants it or that there is simply not enough time to build a part by Musk’s deadline.
“Elon will say, ‘Fine. You’re off the project, and I am now the CEO of the project. I will do your job
and be CEO of two companies at the same time. I will deliver it,’” Brogan said. “What’s crazy is that
Elon actually does it. Every time he’s fired someone and taken their job, he’s delivered on whatever
the project was.”
It is jarring for both parties when the SpaceX culture rubs against more bureaucratic bodies like
NASA, the U.S. Air Force, and the Federal Aviation Administration. The first inklings of these
difficulties appeared on Kwaj, where government officials sometimes questioned what they saw as
SpaceX’s cavalier approach to the launch process. There were times when SpaceX would want to
make a change to its launch procedures and any such change would require a pile of paperwork.
SpaceX, for example, would have written down all the steps needed to replace a filter—put on
gloves, wear safety goggles, remove a nut—and then want to alter this procedure or use a different
type of filter. The FAA would need a week to review the new process before SpaceX could actually
go about changing the filter on the rocket, a lag that both the engineers and Musk found ridiculous. On
one occasion after this type of thing happened, Musk laid into an FAA official while on a conference
call with members of the SpaceX team and NASA. “It got hot and heated, and he berated this guy on a
personal level for like ten minutes,” Brogan said.
Musk did not recall this incident but did remember other confrontations with the FAA. One time
he compiled a list of things an FAA subordinate had said during a meeting that Musk found silly and
sent the list along to the guy’s boss. “And then his dingbat manager sent me this long e-mail about how
he had been in the shuttle program and in charge of twenty launches or something like that and how
dare I say that the other guy was wrong,” Musk said. “I told him, ‘Not only is he wrong, and let me
rearticulate the reasons, but you’re wrong, and let me articulate the reasons.’ I don’t think he sent me
another e-mail after that. We’re trying to have a really big impact on the space industry. If the rules
are such that you can’t make progress, then you have to fight the rules.
“There is a fundamental problem with regulators. If a regulator agrees to change a rule and
something bad happens, they could easily lose their career. Whereas if they change a rule and
something good happens, they don’t even get a reward. So, it’s very asymmetric. It’s then very easy to
understand why regulators resist changing the rules. It’s because there’s a big punishment on one side
and no reward on the other. How would any rational person behave in such a scenario?”
In the middle of 2009, SpaceX hired Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut, as its vice president of
astronaut safety and mission assurance. Bowersox fit the mold of recruit prized by a classic big
aerospace company. He had a degree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, had
been a test pilot in the air force, and flew on the space shuttle a handful of times. Many people within
SpaceX saw his arrival at the company as a good thing. He was considered a diligent, dignified sort
who would provide a second set of eyes to many of SpaceX’s procedures, checking to make sure thecompany went about things in a safe, standardized manner. Bowersox ended up smack in the middle
of the constant pull and push at SpaceX between doing things efficiently and agonizing over
traditional procedures. He and Musk were increasingly at odds as the months passed, and Bowersox
started to feel as if his opinions were being ignored. During one incident in particular, a part made it
all the way to the test stand with a major flaw—described by one engineer as the equivalent of a
coffee cup not having a bottom—instead of being caught at the factory. According to observers,
Bowersox argued that SpaceX should go back and investigate the process that led to the mistake and
fix its root cause. Musk had already decided that he knew the basis of the problem and dismissed
Bowersox after a couple of years on the job. (Bowersox declined to speak on the record about his
time at SpaceX.) A number of people inside SpaceX saw the Bowersox incident as an example of
Musk’s hard-charging manner undermining some much-needed process. Musk had a totally different
take on the situation, casting Bowersox as not being up to the engineering demands at SpaceX.
A handful of high-ranking government officials gave me their candid takes on Musk, albeit without
being willing to put their names to the remarks. One found Musk’s treatment of air force generals and
military men of similar rank appalling. Musk has been known to let even high-ranking officials have it
when he thinks they’re off base and is not apologetic about this. Another could not believe it when
Musk would call very intelligent people idiots. “Imagine the worst possible way that could come out,
and it would come out,” this person said. “Life with Elon is like being in a very intimate married
couple. He can be so gentle and loyal and then really hard on people when it isn’t necessary.” One
former official felt that Musk would need to temper himself better in the years to come if SpaceX was
to keep currying favor with the military and government agencies in its bid to defeat the incumbent
contractors. “His biggest enemy will be himself and the way he treats people,” this person said.
When Musk rubs outsiders the wrong way, Shotwell is often there to try to smooth over the
situation. Like Musk, she has a salty tongue and a fiery personality, but Shotwell is willing to play the
role of the conciliator. These skills have allowed her to handle the day-to-day operations at SpaceX,
leaving Musk to focus on the company’s overall strategy, the product designs, marketing, and
motivating employees. Like all of Musk’s most trusted lieutenants, Shotwell has been willing to stay
largely in the background, do her work, and focus on the company’s cause.
Shotwell grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, the daughter of an artist (mom) and a neurosurgeon
(dad). She played the part of a bright, pretty girl, getting straight A’s at school and joining the
cheerleading squad. Shotwell had not expressed a major inclination toward the sciences and knew
only one version of an engineer—the guy who drives a train. But there were clues that she was wired
a bit different. She was the daughter who mowed the lawn and helped put the family basketball hoop
together. In third grade, Shotwell developed a brief interest in car engines, and her mom bought a
book detailing how they work. Later, in high school, Shotwell’s mom forced her to attend a lecture at
the Illinois Institute of Technology on a Saturday afternoon. As Shotwell listened to one of the panels,
she grew enamored with a fifty-year-old mechanical engineer. “She had these beautiful clothes, this
suit and shoes that I loved,” Shotwell said. “She was tall and carried off the heels really well.”
Shotwell chatted with the engineer after the talk, learning about her job. “That was the day I decided
to become a mechanical engineer,” she said.
Shotwell went on to receive an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s
degree in applied mathematics from Northwestern University. Then she took a job at Chrysler. It was
a type of management training program meant for hotshot recent graduates who appeared to haveleadership potential. Shotwell started out going to auto mechanics school—“I loved that”—and then
from department to department. While working on engines research, Shotwell found that there were
two very expensive Cray supercomputers sitting idle because none of the veterans knew how to use
them. A short while later, she logged onto the computers and set them up to run computational fluid
dynamics, or CFD, operations to simulate the performance of valves and other components. The work
kept Shotwell interested, but the environment started to grate on her. There were rules for everything,
including lots of union regulations around who could operate certain machines. “I picked up a tool
once, and got written up,” she said. “Then I opened a bottle of liquid nitrogen and got written up. I
started thinking that the job was not what I had anticipated it would be.”
Shotwell pulled out of the Chrysler training program, regrouped at home, and then briefly pursued
her doctorate in applied mathematics. While back on the Northwestern campus, one of her professors
mentioned an opportunity at the Aerospace Corporation. Anything but a household name, Aerospace
Corporation has been headquartered in El Segundo since 1960, serving as a kind of neutral, nonprofit
organization that advises the air force, NASA, and other federal bodies on space programs. The
company has a bureaucratic feel but has proved very useful over the years with its research activities
and ability to champion and nix costly endeavors. Shotwell started at Aerospace in October 1988 and
worked on a wide range of projects. One job required her to develop a thermal model that depicted
how temperature fluctuations in the space shuttle’s cargo bay affected the performance of equipment
on various payloads. She spent ten years at Aerospace and honed her skills as a systems engineer. By
the end, though, Shotwell had become irritated by the pace of the industry. “I didn’t understand why it
had to take fifteen years to make a military satellite,” she said. “You could see my interest was
waning.”
For the next four years, Shotwell worked at Microcosm, a space start-up just down the road from
the Aerospace Corporation, and became the head of its space systems division and business
development. Boasting a combination of smarts, confidence, direct talk, and good looks, Shotwell
developed a reputation as a strong saleswoman. In 2002, one of her coworkers, Hans Koenigsmann,
left for SpaceX. Shotwell took Koenigsmann out for a going-away lunch and dropped him off at
SpaceX’s then rinky-dink headquarters. “Hans told me to go in and meet Elon,” Shotwell said. “I did,
and that’s when I told him, ‘You need a good business development person.’” The next day Mary Beth
Brown called Shotwell and told her that Musk wanted to interview her for the new vice president of
business development position. Shotwell ended up as employee No. 7. “I gave three weeks’ notice at
Microcosm and remodeled my bathroom because I knew I would not have a life after taking the job,”
she said.
Through the early years of SpaceX, Shotwell pulled off the miraculous feat of selling something
the company did not have. It took SpaceX so much longer than it had planned to have a successful
flight. The failures along the way were embarrassing and bad for business. Nonetheless, Shotwell
managed to sell about a dozen flights to a mix of government and commercial customers before
SpaceX put its first Falcon 1 into orbit. Her deal-making skills extended to negotiating the big-ticket
contracts with NASA that kept SpaceX alive during its leanest years, including a $278 million
contract in August 2006 to begin work on vehicles that could ferry supplies to the ISS. Shotwell’s
track record of success turned her into Musk’s ultimate confidante at SpaceX, and at the end of 2008,
she became president and chief operating officer at the company.
Part of Shotwell’s duties include reinforcing the SpaceX culture as the company grows larger andlarger and starts to resemble the traditional aerospace giants that it likes to mock. Shotwell can
switch on an easygoing, affable air and address the entire company during a meeting or convince a
collection of possible recruits why they should sign up to be worked to the bone. During one such
meeting with a group of interns, Shotwell pulled about a hundred people into the corner of the
cafeteria. She wore high-heel black boots, skintight jeans, a tan jacket, and a scarf and had big hoop
earnings dangling beside her shoulder-length blond hair. Pacing back and forth in front of the group
with a microphone in hand, she asked them to announce what school they came from and what project
they were working on while at SpaceX. One student went to Cornell and worked on Dragon, another
went to USC and did propulsion system design, and another went to the University of Illinois and
worked with the aerodynamics group. It took about thirty minutes to make it all the way around the
room, and the students were, at least by academic pedigree and bright-eyed enthusiasm, among the
most impressive youngsters in the world. The students peppered Shotwell with questions—her best
moment, her advice for being successful, SpaceX’s competitive threats—and she replied with a mix
of earnest answers and rah-rah stuff. Shotwell made sure to emphasize the lean, innovative edge
SpaceX has over the more traditional aerospace companies. “Our competitors are scared shitless of
us,” Shotwell told the group. “The behemoths are going to have to figure out how to get it together and
compete. And it is our job to have them die.”
One of SpaceX’s biggest goals, Shotwell said, was to fly as often as possible. The company has
never sought to make a fortune off each flight. It would rather make a little on each launch and keep
the flights flowing. A Falcon 9 flight costs $60 million, and the company would like to see that figure
drop to about $20 million through economies of scale and improvements in launch technology.
SpaceX spent $2.5 billion to get four Dragon capsules to the ISS, nine flights with the Falcon 9, and
five flights with the Falcon 1. It’s a price-per-launch total that the rest of the players in the industry
cannot comprehend let alone aspire to. “I don’t know what those guys do with their money,” Shotwell
said. “They are smoking it. I just don’t know.” As Shotwell saw it, a number of new nations were
showing interest in launches, eyeing communications technology as essential to growing their
economies and leveling their status with developed nations. Cheaper flights would help SpaceX take
the majority of the business from that new customer set. The company also expected to participate in
an expanding market for human flights. SpaceX has never had any interest in doing the five-minute
tourist flights to low Earth orbit like Virgin Galactic and XCOR. It does, however, have the ability to
carry researchers to orbiting habitats being built by Bigelow Aerospace and to orbiting science labs
being constructed by various countries. SpaceX will also start making its own satellites, turning the
company into a one-stop space shop. All of these plans hinge on SpaceX being able to prove that it
can fly on schedule every month and churn through the $5 billion backlog of launches. “Most of our
customers signed up early and wanted to be supportive and got good deals on their missions,” she
said. “We are in a phase now where we need to launch on time and make launching Dragons more
efficient.”
For a short while, the conversation with the interns bogged down. It turned to some of the
annoyances of SpaceX’s campus. The company leases its facility and has not been able to build things
like a massive parking structure that would make life easier for its three-thousand-person workforce.
Shotwell promised that more parking, more bathrooms, and more of the freebies that technology startups in Silicon Valley offer their employees would be on the way. “I want a day care,” she said.
But it was while discussing SpaceX’s grandest missions that Shotwell really came into her ownand seemed to inspire the interns. Some of them clearly dreamed of becoming astronauts, and
Shotwell said that working at SpaceX was almost certainly their best chance to get to space now that
NASA’s astronaut corps had dwindled. Musk had made designing cool-looking, “non–Stay Puft”
spacesuits a personal priority. “They can’t be clunky and nasty,” Shotwell said. “You have to do
better than that.” As for where the astronauts would go: well, there were the space habitats, the moon,
and, of course, Mars as options. SpaceX has already started testing a giant rocket, called the Falcon
Heavy, that will take it much farther into space than the Falcon 9, and it has another, even larger
spaceship on the way. “Our Falcon Heavy rocket will not take a busload of people to Mars,” she
said. “So, there’s something after Heavy. We’re working on it.” To make something like that vehicle
happen, she said, the SpaceX employees needed to be effective and pushy. “Make sure your output is
high,” Shotwell said. “If we’re throwing a bunch of shit in your way, you need to be mouthy about it.
That’s not a quality that’s widely accepted elsewhere, but it is at SpaceX.” And, if that sounded harsh,
so be it. As Shotwell saw it, the commercial space race was coming down to SpaceX and China and
that’s it. And in the bigger picture, the race was on to ensure man’s survival. “If you hate people and
think human extinction is okay, then fuck it,” Shotwell said. “Don’t go to space. If you think it is worth
humans doing some risk management and finding a second place to go live, then you should be
focused on this issue and willing to spend some money. I am pretty sure we will be selected by
NASA to drop landers and rovers off on Mars. Then the first SpaceX mission will be to drop off a
bunch of supplies, so that once people get there, there will be places to live and food to eat and stuff
for them to do.”
It’s talk like this that thrills and amazes people in the aerospace industry, who have long been
hoping that some company would come along and truly revolutionize space travel. Aeronautics
experts will point out that twenty years after the Wright brothers started their experiments, air travel
had become routine. The launch business, by contrast, appears to have frozen. We’ve been to the
moon, sent research vehicles to Mars, and explored the solar system, but all of these things are still
immensely expensive one-off projects. “The cost remains extraordinarily high because of the rocket
equation,” said Carol Stoker, the planetary scientist at NASA. Thanks to military and government
contracts from agencies like NASA, the aerospace industry has historically had massive budgets to
work with and tried to make the biggest, most reliable machines it could. The business has been tuned
to strive for maximum performance, so that the aerospace contractors can say they met their
requirements. That strategy makes sense if you’re trying to send up a $1 billion military satellite for
the U.S. government and simply cannot afford for the payload to blow up. But on the whole, this
approach stifles the pursuit of other endeavors. It leads to bloat and excess and a crippling of the
commercial space industry.
Outside of SpaceX, the American launch providers are no longer competitive against their peers
in other countries. They have limited launch abilities and questionable ambition. SpaceX’s main
competitor for domestic military satellites and other large payloads is United Launch Alliance (ULA),
a joint venture formed in 2006 when Boeing and Lockheed Martin combined forces. The thinking at
the time about the union was that the government did not have enough business for two companies and
that combining the research and manufacturing work of Boeing and Lockheed would result in cheaper,
safer launches. ULA has leaned on decades of work around the Delta (Boeing) and Atlas (Lockheed)
launch vehicles and has flown many dozens of rockets successfully, making it a model of reliability.
But neither the joint venture nor Boeing nor Lockheed, both of which can offer commercial serviceson their own, come close to competing on price against SpaceX, the Russians, or the Chinese. “For
the most part, the global commercial market is dominated by Arianespace [Europe], Long March
[China] or Russian vehicles,” said Dave Bearden, the general manager of civil and commercial
programs at the Aerospace Corporation. “There are just different labor rates and differences in the
way they are built.”
To put things more bluntly, ULA has turned into an embarrassment for the United States. In March
2014, ULA’s then CEO, Michael Gass, faced off against Musk during a congressional hearing that
dealt, in part, with SpaceX’s request to take on more of the government’s annual launch load. A series
of slides were rolled out that showed how the government payments for launches have skyrocketed
since Boeing and Lockheed went from a duopoly to a monopoly. According to Musk’s math presented
at the hearing, ULA charged $380 million per flight, while SpaceX would charge $90 million per
flight. (The $90 million figure was higher than SpaceX’s standard $60 million because the
government has certain additional requirements for particularly sensitive launches.) By simply
picking SpaceX as its launch provider, Musk pointed out, the government would save enough money
to pay for the satellite going on the rocket. Gass had no real retort. He claimed Musk’s figures for the
ULA launch price were inaccurate but failed to provide a figure of his own. The hearing also came as
tensions between the United States and Russia were running high due to Russia’s aggressive actions
in Ukraine. Musk rightly noted that the United States could soon be placing sanctions on Russia that
could carry over to aerospace equipment. ULA, as it happens, relies on Russian-made engines to send
up sensitive U.S. military equipment in its Atlas V rockets. “Our Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch
vehicles are truly American,” Musk said. “We design and manufacture our rockets in California and
Texas.” Gass countered that ULA had bought a two-year supply of Russian engines and purchased the
blueprints to the machines and had them translated from Russian to English, and he said this with a
straight face. (A few months after the hearing, ULA replaced Gass as CEO and signed a deal with
Blue Origin to develop American-made rockets.)
Some of the most disheartening moments of the hearing arrived when Senator Richard Shelby of
Alabama took the microphone for questioning. ULA has manufacturing facilities in Alabama and close
ties to the senator. Shelby felt compelled to play the role of hometown booster by repeatedly pointing
out that ULA had enjoyed sixty-eight successful launches and then asking Musk what he made of that
accomplishment. The aerospace industry stands as one of Shelby’s biggest donors and he’s ended up
surprisingly pro-bureaucracy and anticompetition when it comes to getting things into space.
“Typically competition results in better quality and lower-priced contracts—but the launch market is
not typical,” Shelby said. “It is limited demand framed by government-industrial policies.” The
March hearing in which Shelby made these statements would turn out to be something of a sham. The
government had agreed to put fourteen of its sensitive launches up for bid instead of just awarding
them directly to ULA. Musk had come to Congress to present his case for why SpaceX made sense as
a viable candidate for those and other launches. The day after the hearing, the air force cut the number
of launches up for bid from fourteen to between seven and one. One month later, SpaceX filed a
lawsuit against the air force asking for a chance to earn its launch business. “SpaceX is not seeking to
be awarded contracts for these launches,” the company said on its freedomtolaunch.com website. “We
are simply seeking the right to compete.”*
SpaceX’s main competitor for ISS resupply missions and commercial satellites in the United
States is Orbital Sciences Corporation. Founded in Virginia in 1982, the company started out notunlike SpaceX, as the new kid that raised outside funding and focused on putting smaller satellites
into low-Earth orbit. Orbital is more experienced, although it has a limited roster of machine types.
Orbital depends on suppliers, including Russian and Ukrainian companies, for its engines and rocket
bodies, making it more of an assembler of spacecraft than a true builder like SpaceX. And, also
unlike SpaceX, Orbital’s capsules cannot withstand the journey back from the ISS to Earth, so it’s
unable to return experiments and other goods. In October 2014, one of Orbital’s rockets blew up on
the launchpad. With its ability to launch on hold while it investigated the incident, Orbital reached out
to SpaceX for help. It wanted to see if Musk had any extra capacity to take care of some of Orbital’s
customers. The company also signaled that it would move away from using Russian engines as well.
As for getting humans to space, SpaceX and Boeing were the victors in a four-year NASA
competition to fly astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX will get $2.6 billion, and Boeing will get $4.2 billion
to develop their capsules and ferry people to the ISS by 2017. The companies would, in effect, be
replacing the space shuttle and restoring the United States’ ability to conduct manned flights. “I
actually don’t mind that Boeing gets twice as much money for meeting the same NASA requirements
as SpaceX with worse technology,” Musk said. “Having two companies involved is better for the
advancement of human spaceflight.”
SpaceX had once looked like it too would be a one-trick pony. The company’s original plans
were to have the smallish Falcon 1 function as its primary workhorse. At $6 million to $12 million
per flight, the Falcon 1 was by far the cheapest means of getting something into orbit, thrilling people
in the space industry. When Google announced its Lunar X Prize in 2007—$30 million in awards to
people who could land a robot on the moon—many of the proposals that followed selected the Falcon
1 as their preferred launch vehicle because it seemed like the only reasonably priced option for
getting something to the moon. Scientists around the world were equally excited, thinking that for the
first time they had a means of placing experiments into orbit in a cost-effective way. But for all the
enthusiastic talk about the Falcon 1, the demand never arrived. “It became very clear that there was a
huge need for the Falcon 1 but no money for it,” said Shotwell. “The market has to be able to sustain a
certain amount of vehicles, and three Falcon 1s per year does not make a business.” The last Falcon 1
launch took place in July 2009 from Kwajalein, when SpaceX carried a satellite into orbit for the
Malaysian government. People in the aerospace industry have been grumbling ever since. “We gave
Falcon 1 a hell of a shot,” Shotwell said. “I was emotional about it and disappointed. I’d anticipated
a flood of orders but, after eight years, they just did not come.”
SpaceX has since expanded its launch capabilities at a remarkable pace and looks like it might be
on the verge of getting that $12 million per flight option back. In June 2010, the Falcon 9 flew for the
first time and orbited Earth successfully. In December 2010, SpaceX proved that the Falcon 9 could
carry the Dragon capsule into space and that the capsule could be recovered safely after an ocean
landing.* It became the first commercial company ever to pull off this feat. Then, in May 2012,
SpaceX went through the most significant moment in the company’s history since that first successful
launch on Kwajalein.
On May 22, at 3:44 A.M., a Falcon 9 rocket took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape
Canaveral, Florida. The rocket did its yeoman-like work boosting Dragon into space. Then the
capsule’s solar panels fanned out and Dragon became dependent on its eighteen Draco thrusters, or
small rocket engines, to guide its path to the International Space Station. The SpaceX engineers
worked in shifts—some of them sleeping on cots at the factory—as it took the capsule three days forDragon to make its journey. They spent most of the time observing Dragon’s flight and checking to see
that its sensor systems were picking up the ISS. Originally, Dragon planned to dock with the ISS
around 4 A.M. on the twenty-fifth, but as the capsule approached the space station, an unexpected glint
kept throwing off the calculations of a laser used to measure the distance between Dragon and the
ISS. “I remember it being two and a half hours of struggle,” Shotwell said. Her outfit of Uggs, a
fishnet sweater, and leggings started to feel like pajamas as the night wore on, and the engineers
battled this unplanned difficulty. Fearing all the time that the mission would be aborted, SpaceX
decided to upload some new software to the Dragon that would cut the size of the visual frame used
by the sensors to eliminate the effect of the sunlight on the machine. Then, just before 7 A.M., Dragon
got close enough to the ISS for Don Pettit, an astronaut, to use a fifty-eight-foot robotic arm to reach
out and grab the resupply capsule. “Houston, Station, it looks like we’ve got us a dragon by the tail,”
Pettit said.13
“I’d been digesting my guts,” Shotwell said. “And then I am drinking champagne at six in the
morning.” About thirty people were in the control room when the docking happened. Over the next
couple of hours, workers streamed into the SpaceX factory to soak up the elation of the moment.
SpaceX had set another first, as the only private company to dock with the ISS. A couple of months
later SpaceX received $440 million from NASA to keep developing Dragon so that it could transport
people. “Elon is changing the way aerospace business is done,” said NASA’s Stoker. “He’s managed
to keep the safety factor up while cutting costs. He’s just taken the best things from the tech industry
like the open-floor office plans and having everyone talking and all this human interaction. It’s a very
different way to most of the aerospace industry, which is designed to produce requirements
documents and project reviews.”
In May 2014, Musk invited the press to SpaceX’s headquarters to demonstrate what some of that
NASA money had bought. He unveiled the Dragon V2, or version two, spacecraft. Unlike most
executives, who like to show their products off at trade shows or daytime events, Musk prefers to
hold true Hollywood-style galas in the evenings. People arrived in Hawthorne by the hundreds and
snacked on hors d’oeuvres until the 7:30 P.M. showing. Musk appeared wearing a purplish velvet
jacket and popping open the capsule’s door with a bump of his fist like the Fonz. What he revealed
was spectacular. The cramped quarters of past capsules were gone. There were seven thin, sturdy,
contoured seats arranged with four seats close to the main console and a row of three seats in the
back. Musk walked around in the capsule to show how roomy it was and then plopped down in the
central captain’s chair. He reached up and unlocked a four-paneled flat-screen console that gracefully
slid down right in front of the first row of seats.* In the middle of the console was a joystick for flying
the aircraft and some physical buttons for essential functions that astronauts could press in case of an
emergency or a malfunctioning touch-screen. The inside of the capsule had a bright, metallic finish.
Someone had finally built a spaceship worthy of scientist and moviemaker dreams.
There was substance to go with the style. The Dragon 2 will be able to dock with the ISS and
other space habitats automatically without needing the intervention of a robotic arm. It will run on a
SuperDraco engine—a thruster made by SpaceX and the first engine ever built completely by a 3-D
printer to go into space. This means that a machine guided by a computer formed the engine out of
single piece of metal—in this case the high-strength alloy Inconel—so that its strength and
performance should exceed anything built by humans by welding various parts together. And most
mind-boggling of all, Musk revealed that the Dragon 2 will be able to land anywhere on Earth thatSpaceX wants by using the SuperDraco engines and thrusters to come to a gentle stop on the ground.
No more landings at sea. No more throwing spaceships away. “That is how a twenty-first-century
spaceship should land,” Musk said. “You can just reload propellant and fly again. So long as we
continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft, we will never have true access to space.”
The Dragon 2 is just one of the machines that SpaceX continues to develop in parallel. One of the
company’s next milestones will be the first flight of the Falcon Heavy, which is designed to be the
world’s most powerful rocket.* SpaceX has found a way to combine three Falcon 9s into a single
craft with 27 of the Merlin engines and the ability to carry more than 53 metric tons of stuff into orbit.
Part of the genius of Musk and Mueller’s designs is that SpaceX can reuse the same engine in
different configurations—from the Falcon 1 up to the Falcon Heavy—saving on cost and time. “We
make our main combustion chambers, turbo pump, gas generators, injectors, and main valves,”
Mueller said. “We have complete control. We have our own test site, while most of the other guys use
government test sites. The labor hours are cut in half and so is the work around the materials. Four
years ago, we could make two rockets a year and now we can make twenty a year.” SpaceX boasts
that the Falcon Heavy can take up twice the payload of the nearest competitor—the Delta IV Heavy
from Boeing/ULA—at one-third the cost. SpaceX is also busy building a spaceport from the ground
up. The goal is to be able to launch many rockets an hour from this facility located in Brownsville,
Texas, by automating the processes needed to stand a rocket up on the pad, fuel it, and send it off.
Just as it did in the early days, SpaceX continues to experiment with these new vehicles during
actual launches in ways that other companies would dare not do. SpaceX will often announce that it’s
trying out a new engine or its landing legs and place the emphasis on that one upgrade in the marketing
material leading up to a launch. It’s common, though, for SpaceX to test out a dozen other objectives
in secret during a mission. Musk essentially asks employees to do the impossible on top of the
impossible. One former SpaceX executive described the working atmosphere as a perpetual-motion
machine that runs on a weird mix of dissatisfaction and eternal hope. “It’s like he has everyone
working on this car that is meant to get from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas,” this
executive said. “They will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when they set off
for New York after that year, all of the vice presidents think privately that the car will be lucky to get
to Las Vegas. What ends up happening is that the car gets to New Mexico—twice as far as they ever
expected—and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out of people.”
There’s a degree to which it’s just never enough for Musk, no matter what it is. Case in point: the
December 2010 launch in which SpaceX got the Dragon capsule to orbit Earth and return
successfully. This had been one of the company’s great achievements, and people had worked
tirelessly for months, if not years. The launch had taken place on December 8, and SpaceX had a
Christmas party on December 16. About ninety minutes before the party started, Musk had called his
top executives to SpaceX for a meeting. Six of them, including Mueller, were decked out in party
attire and ready to celebrate the holidays and SpaceX’s historic achievement around Dragon. Musk
laid into them for about an hour because the truss structure for a future rocket was running behind
schedule. “Their wives were sitting three cubes over waiting for the berating to end,” Brogan said.
Other examples of similar behavior have cropped up from time to time. Musk, for example, rewarded
a group of thirty employees who had pulled off a tough project for NASA with bonuses that consisted
of additional stock option grants. Many of the employees, seeking instant, more tangible gratification,
demanded cash. “He chided us for not valuing the stock,” Drew Eldeen, a former engineer, said. “Hesaid, ‘In the long run, this is worth a lot more than a thousand dollars in cash.’ He wasn’t screaming
or anything like that, but he seemed disappointed in us. It was hard to hear that.”
The lingering question for many SpaceX employees is when exactly they will see a big reward for
all their work. SpaceX’s staff is paid well but by no means exorbitantly. Many of them expect to make
their money when SpaceX files for an initial public offering. The thing is that Musk does not want to
go public anytime soon, and understandably so. It’s a bit hard to explain the whole Mars thing to
investors, when it’s unclear what the business model around starting a colony on another planet will
be. When the employees heard Musk say that an IPO was years away and would not occur until the
Mars mission looked more secure, they started to grumble, and when Musk found out, he addressed
all of SpaceX in an e-mail that is a fantastic window into his thinking and how it differs from almost
every other CEO’s. (The full e-mail appears in Appendix 3.)

Going Public
Per my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about SpaceX going public before
the Mars transport system is in place. Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars
is and always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public company diminishes
that likelihood, then we should not do so until Mars is secure. This is something that I am open
to reconsidering, but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to foist
being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature of our mission.
Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that
being public is desirable. This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step
changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal
execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This
causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating
great products.
For those who are under the impression that they are so clever that they can outsmart
public market investors and would sell SpaceX stock at the “right time,” let me relieve you of
any such notion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is no need
to worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can just invest in other public company
stocks and make billions of dollars in the market.
Elon10THE REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR
THERE ARE SO MANY TELEVISION COMMERCIALS FOR CARS AND TRUCKS that it’s easy
to become immune to them and ignore what’s taking place in the ads. That’s okay. Because there’s not
really much of note happening. Carmakers looking to put a modicum of effort into their ads have been
hawking the exact same things for decades: a car with a bit more room, a few extra miles per gallon,
better handling, or an extra cup holder. Those that can’t find anything interesting at all to tout about
their cars turn to scantily clad women, men with British accents, and, when necessary, dancing mice
in tuxedos to try and convince people that their products are better than the rest. Next time a car ad
appears on your television, pause for a moment and really listen to what’s being said. When you
realize that the Volkswagen sign-and-drive “event” is code for “we’re making the experience of
buying a car slightly less miserable than usual,” you’ll start to appreciate just how low the automotive
industry has sunk.
In the middle of 2012, Tesla Motors stunned its complacent peers in the automotive industry. It
began shipping the Model S sedan. This all-electric luxury vehicle could go more than 300 miles on a
single charge. It could reach 60 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds. It could seat seven people, if you used
a couple of optional rear-facing seats in the back for kids. It also had two trunks. There was the
standard one and then what Tesla calls a “frunk” up front, where the bulky engine would usually be.
The Model S ran on an electric battery pack that makes up the base of the car and a watermelon-sized
electric motor located between the rear tires. Getting rid of the engine and its din of clanging
machinery also meant that the Model S ran silently. The Model S outclassed most other luxury sedans
in terms of raw speed, mileage, handling, and storage space.
And there was more—like a cutesy thing with the door handles, which were flush with the car’s
body until the driver got close to the Model S. Then the silver handles would pop out, the driver
would open the door and get in, and the handles would retract flush with the car’s body again. Once
inside, the driver encountered a seventeen-inch touch-screen that controlled the vast majority of the
car’s functions, be it raising the volume on the stereo* or opening the sunroof with a slide of the
finger. Whereas most cars have a large dashboard to accommodate various displays and buttons and
to protect people from the noise of the engine, the Model S offered up vast amounts of space. The
Model S had an ever-present Internet connection, allowing the driver to stream music through the
touch console and to display massive Google maps for navigation. The driver didn’t need to turn a
key or even push an ignition button to start the car. His weight in the seat coupled with a sensor in the
key fob, which is shaped like a tiny Model S, was enough to activate the vehicle. Made of lightweight
aluminum, the car achieved the highest safety rating in history. And it could be recharged for free at
Tesla’s stations lining highways across the United States and later around the world.
For both engineers and green-minded people, the Model S presented a model of efficiency.
Traditional cars and hybrids have anywhere from hundreds to thousands of moving parts. The engine
must perform constant, controlled explosions with pistons, crankshafts, oil filters, alternators, fans,
distributors, valves, coils, and cylinders among the many pieces of machinery needed for the work.The oomph produced by the engine must then be passed through clutches, gears, and driveshafts to
make the wheels turn, and then exhaust systems have to deal with the waste. Cars end up being about
10–20 percent efficient at turning the input of gasoline into the output of propulsion. Most of the
energy (about 70 percent) is lost as heat in the engine, while the rest is lost through wind resistance,
braking, and other mechanical functions. The Model S, by contrast, has about a dozen moving parts,
with the battery pack sending energy instantly to a watermelon-sized motor that turns the wheels. The
Model S ends up being about 60 percent efficient, losing most of the rest of its energy to heat. The
sedan gets the equivalent of about 100 miles per gallon.*
Yet another distinguishing characteristic of the Model S was the experience of buying and owning
the car. You didn’t go to a dealership and haggle with a pushy salesman. Tesla sold the Model S
directly through its own stores and website. Typically, the stores were placed in high-end malls or
affluent suburbs, not far from the Apple stores on which they were modeled. Customers would walk
in and find a complete Model S in the middle of the shop and often an exposed version of the car’s
base near the back of the store to show off the battery pack and motor. There were massive touchscreens where people could calculate how much they might save on fuel costs by moving to an allelectric car, and where they could configure the look and add-ons for their future Model S. Once the
configuration process was done, the customer could give the screen a big, forceful swipe and his
Model S would theatrically appear on an even bigger screen in the center of the store. If you wanted
to sit in the display model, a salesman would pull back a red velvet rope near the driver’s-side door
and let you enter the car. The salespeople were not compensated on commission and didn’t have to try
to talk you into buying a suite of extras. Whether you ultimately bought the car in the store or online, it
was delivered in a concierge fashion. Tesla would bring it to your home, office, or anywhere else you
wanted it. The company also offered customers the option of picking their cars up from the factory in
Silicon Valley and treating their friends and family to a complimentary tour of the facility. In the
months that followed the delivery, there were no oil changes or tune-ups to be dealt with because the
Model S didn’t need them. It had done away with so much of the mechanical dreck standard in an
internal combustion vehicle. However, if something did go wrong with the car, Tesla would come
pick it up and give the customer a loaner while it repaired the Model S.
The Model S also offered a way to fix issues in a manner that people had never before
encountered with a mass-produced car. Some of the early owners complained about glitches like the
door handles not popping out quite right or their windshield wipers operating at funky speeds. These
were inexcusable flaws for such a costly vehicle, but Tesla typically moved with clever efficiency to
address them. While the owner slept, Tesla’s engineers tapped into the car via the Internet connection
and downloaded software updates. When the customer took the car out for a spin in the morning and
found it working right, he was left feeling as if magical elves had done the work. Tesla soon began
showing off its software skills for jobs other than making up for mistakes. It put out a smartphone app
that let people turn on their air-conditioning or heating from afar and to see where the car was parked
on a map. Tesla also began installing software updates that imbued the Model S with new features.
Overnight, the Model S sometimes got new traction controls for hilly and highway driving or could
suddenly recharge much faster than before or possess a new range of voice controls. Tesla had
transformed the car into a gadget—a device that actually got better after you bought it. As Craig
Venter, one of the earliest Model S owners and the famed scientist who first decoded man’s DNA, put
it, “It changes everything about transportation. It’s a computer on wheels.”The first people to notice what Tesla had accomplished were the technophiles in Silicon Valley.
The region is filled with early adopters willing to buy the latest gizmos and suffer through their bugs.
Normally this habit applies to computing devices ranging from $100 to $2,000 in price. This time
around, the early adopters proved willing not only to spend $100,000 on a product that might not
work but also to trust their well-being to a start-up. Tesla needed this early boost of confidence and
got it on a scale few expected. In the first couple of months after the Model S went on sale, you might
see one or two per day on the streets of San Francisco and the surrounding cities. Then you started to
see five to ten per day. Soon enough, the Model S seemed to feel like the most common car in Palo
Alto and Mountain View, the two cities at the heart of Silicon Valley. The Model S emerged as the
ultimate status symbol for wealthy technophiles, allowing them to show off, get a new gadget, and
claim to be helping the environment at the same time. From Silicon Valley, the Model S phenomenon
spread to Los Angeles, then all along the West Coast and then to Washington, D.C., and New York
(although to a lesser degree).
At first the more traditional automakers viewed the Model S as a gimmick and its surging sales as
part of a fad. These sentiments, however, soon gave way to something more akin to panic. In
November 2012, just a few months after it started shipping, the Model S was named Motor Trend’s
Car of the Year in the first unanimous vote that anyone at the magazine could remember. The Model S
beat out eleven other vehicles from companies such as Porsche, BMW, Lexus, and Subaru and was
heralded as “proof positive that America can still make great things.” Motor Trend celebrated the
Model S as the first non–internal combustion engine car ever to win its top award and wrote that the
vehicle handled like a sports car, drove as smoothly as a Rolls-Royce, held as much as a Chevy
Equinox, and was more efficient than a Toyota Prius. Several months later, Consumer Reports gave
the Model S its highest car rating in history—99 out of 100—while proclaiming that it was likely the
best car ever built. It was at about this time that sales of the Model S started to soar alongside Tesla’s
share price and that General Motors, among other automakers, pulled together a team to study the
Model S, Tesla, and the methods of Elon Musk.
It’s worth pausing for a moment to meditate on what Tesla had accomplished. Musk had set out to
make an electric car that did not suffer from any compromises. He did that. Then, using a form of
entrepreneurial judo, he upended the decades of criticisms against electric cars. The Model S was not
just the best electric car; it was best car, period, and the car people desired. America had not seen a
successful car company since Chrysler emerged in 1925. Silicon Valley had done little of note in the
automotive industry. Musk had never run a car factory before and was considered arrogant and
amateurish by Detroit. Yet, one year after the Model S went on sale, Tesla had posted a profit, hit
$562 million in quarterly revenue, raised its sales forecast, and become as valuable as Mazda Motor.
Elon Musk had built the automotive equivalent of the iPhone. And car executives in Detroit, Japan,
and Germany had only their crappy ads to watch as they pondered how such a thing had occurred.
You can forgive the automotive industry veterans for being caught unawares. For years Tesla had
looked like an utter disaster incapable of doing much of anything right. It took until early 2009 for
Tesla to really hit its stride with the Roadster and work out the manufacturing issues behind the sports
car. Just as the company tried to build some momentum around the Roadster, Musk sent out an e-mail
to customers declaring a price hike. Where the car originally started around $92,000, it would now
start at $109,000. In the e-mail, Musk said that four hundred customers who had already placed their
orders for a Roadster but not yet received them would bear the brunt of the price change and need tocough up the extra cash. He tried to assuage Tesla’s customer base by arguing that the company had no
choice but to raise prices. The manufacturing costs for the Roadster had come in much higher than the
company initially expected, and Tesla needed to prove that it could make the cars at a profit to bolster
its chances of securing a large government loan that would be needed to build the Model S, which it
vowed to deliver in 2011. “I firmly believe that the plan . . . strikes a reasonable compromise
between being fair to early customers and ensuring the viability of Tesla, which is obviously in the
best interests of all customers,” Musk wrote in the e-mail. “Mass market electric cars have been my
goal from the beginning of Tesla. I don’t want and I don’t think the vast majority of Tesla customers
want us to do anything to jeopardize that objective.” While some Tesla customers grumbled, Musk
had largely read his customer base right. They would support just about anything he suggested.
Following the price increase, Tesla had a safety recall. It said that Lotus, the manufacturer of the
Roadster’s chassis, had failed to tighten a bolt properly on its assembly line. On the plus side, Tesla
had only delivered about 345 Roadsters, which meant that it could fix the problem in a manageable
fashion. On the downside, a safety recall was the last thing a car start-up needs, even if it was, as
Tesla claimed, more of a proactive measure than anything else. The next year, Tesla had another
voluntary recall. It had received a report of a power cable grinding against the body of the Roadster
to the point that it caused a short circuit and some smoke. That time, Tesla brought 439 Roadsters in
for a fix. Tesla did its best to put a positive spin on these issues, saying that it would make “house
calls” to fix the Roadsters or pick up the cars and take them back to the factory. Ever since, Musk has
tried to turn any snafu with a Tesla into an excuse to show off the company’s attention to service and
dedication to pleasing the customer. More often than not, the strategy has worked.
On top of the occasional issues with the Roadster, Tesla continued to suffer from public
perception problems. In June 2009, Martin Eberhard sued Musk and went to town in the complaint
detailing his ouster from the company. Eberhard accused Musk of libel, slander, and breach of
contract. The charges painted Musk as a bully moneyman who had pushed the soulful inventor out of
his own company. The lawsuit also accused Musk of trumping up his role in Tesla’s founding. Musk
responded in kind, issuing a blog post that detailed his take on Eberhard’s foibles and taking umbrage
at the suggestions that he was not a true founder of the company. A short while later, the two men
settled and agreed to stop going at each other. “As co-founder of the company, Elon’s contributions to
Tesla have been extraordinary,” Eberhard said in a statement at the time. It must have been
excruciating for Eberhard to agree to put that in writing and the very existence of that statement points
to Musk’s skills and tactics as a hard-line negotiator. The two men continue to despise each other
today, although they must do so in private, as legally required. Eberhard, though, holds no longstanding grudge against Tesla. His shares in the company ended up becoming very valuable. He still
drives his Roadster, and his wife got a Model S.
For so much of its early existence, Tesla appeared in the news for the wrong reasons. There were
people in the media and the automotive industry who viewed it as a gimmick. They seemed to delight
in the soap opera–worthy spats between Musk and Eberhard and other disgruntled former employees.
Far from being seen universally as a successful entrepreneur, Musk was viewed in some Silicon
Valley circles as an abrasive blowhard who would get what he deserved when Tesla inevitably
collapsed. The Roadster would make its way to the electric-car graveyard. Detroit would prove that
it had a better handle on this whole car innovation thing than Silicon Valley. The natural order of the
world would remain intact.A funny thing happened, however. Tesla did just enough to survive. From 2008 to 2012, Tesla
sold about 2,500 Roadsters.* The car had accomplished what Musk had intended from the outset. It
proved that electric cars could be fun to drive and that they could be objects of desire. With the
Roadster, Tesla kept electric cars in the public’s consciousness and did so under impossible
circumstances, namely the collapse of the American automotive industry and the global financial
markets. Whether Musk was a founder of Tesla in the purest sense of the word is irrelevant at this
point. There would be no Tesla to talk about today were it not for Musk’s money, marketing savvy,
chicanery, engineering smarts, and indomitable spirit. Tesla was, in effect, willed into existence by
Musk and reflects his personality as much as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple reflect the personalities of
their founders. Marc Tarpenning, the other Tesla cofounder, said as much when he reflected on what
Musk has meant to the company. “Elon pushed Tesla so much farther than we ever imagined,” he said.
As difficult as birthing the Roadster had been, the adventure had whetted Musk’s appetite for what
he could accomplish in the automotive industry with a clean slate. Tesla’s next car—code-named
WhiteStar—would not be an adapted version of another company’s vehicle. It would be made from
scratch and structured to take full advantage of what the electric-car technology offered. The battery
pack in the Roadster, for example, had to be placed near the rear of the car because of constraints
imposed by the Lotus Elise chassis. This was okay but not ideal due to the imposing weight of the
batteries. With WhiteStar, which would become the Model S, Musk and Tesla’s engineers knew from
the start that they would place the 1,300-pound battery pack on the base of the car. This would give
the vehicle a low center of gravity and excellent handling. It would also give the Model S what’s
known as a low polar moment of inertia, which relates to how a car resists turning. Ideally, you want
heavy parts like the engine as close as possible to the car’s center of gravity, which is why the
engines of race cars tend to be near the middle of the vehicle. Traditional cars are a mess on this
metric, with the bulky engine up front, passengers in the middle, and gasoline sloshing around the
rear. In the case of the Model S, the bulk of the car’s mass is very close to the center of gravity and
this has positive follow-on effects to handling, performance, and safety.
The innards, though, were just one part of what would make the Model S shine. Musk wanted to
make a statement with the car’s look as well. It would be a sedan, yes, but it would be a sexy sedan. It
would also be comfortable and luxurious and have none of the compromises that Tesla had been
forced to embrace with the Roadster. To bring such a beautiful, functional car to life, Musk hired
Henrik Fisker, a Danish automobile designer renowned for his work at Aston Martin.
Tesla first revealed its plans for the Model S to Fisker in 2007. It asked him to design a sleek,
four-door sedan that would cost between $50,000 and $70,000. Tesla could still barely make
Roadsters and had no idea if its all-electric powertrain would hold up over time. Musk, though,
refused to wait and find out. He wanted the Model S to ship in late 2009 or early 2010 and needed
Fisker to work fast. By reputation, Fisker had a flair for the dramatic and had produced some of the
most stunning car designs over the past decade, not just for Aston Martin but also for special versions
of BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Fisker had a studio in Orange County, California, and Musk and other Tesla executives would
meet there to go over his evolving takes on the Model S. Each visit was less inspiring than the last.
Fisker baffled the Tesla teams with his stodgy designs. “Some of the early styles were like a giant
egg,” said Ron Lloyd, the former vice president of the WhiteStar project at Tesla. “They were
terrible.” When Musk pushed back, Fisker blamed the physical constraints Tesla had put in place forthe Model S as too restrictive. “He said they would not let him make the car sexy,” Lloyd said. Fisker
tried a couple of different approaches and unveiled some foam models of the car for Musk and his
crew to dissect. “We kept on telling him they were not right,” Lloyd said.
Not long after these meetings, Fisker started his own company—Fisker Automotive—and
unveiled the Fisker Karma hybrid in 2008. This luxury sedan looked like a vehicle Batman might take
out for a Sunday drive. With its elongated lines and sharp edges, the car was stunning and truly
original. “It rapidly became clear that he was trying to compete with us,” Lloyd said. As Musk dug
into the situation, he discovered that Fisker had been shopping his idea for a car company to investors
around Silicon Valley for some time. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the more famous
venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, once had a chance to invest in Tesla and then ended up putting
money into Fisker instead. All of this was too much for Musk, and he launched a lawsuit against
Fisker in 2008, accusing him of stealing Tesla’s ideas and using the $875,000 Tesla had paid for
design work to help get his rival car company off the ground. (Fisker ultimately prevailed in the
dispute with an arbitrator ordering Tesla to reimburse Fisker’s legal fees and deeming Tesla’s
allegations baseless.)
Tesla had thought about doing a hybrid like Fisker where a gas engine would be present to
recharge the car’s batteries after they had consumed an initial charge. The car would be able to travel
fifty to eighty miles after being plugged into an outlet and then take advantage of ubiquitous gas
stations as needed to top up the batteries, eliminating range anxiety. Tesla’s engineers prototyped the
hybrid vehicle and ran all sorts of cost and performance metrics. In the end, they found the hybrid to
be too much of a compromise. “It would be expensive, and the performance would not be as good as
the all-electric car,” said J. B. Straubel. “And we would have needed to build a team to compete with
the core competency of every car company in the world. We would have been betting against all the
things we believe in, like the power electronics and batteries improving. We decided to put all the
effort into going where we think the endpoint is and to never look back.” After coming to this
conclusion, Straubel and others inside Tesla started to let go of their anger toward Fisker. They
figured he would end up delivering a kluge of a car and get what was coming to him.
A large car company might spend $1 billion and need thousands of people to design a new vehicle
and bring it to market. Tesla had nothing close to these resources as it gave birth to the Model S.
According to Lloyd, Tesla initially aimed to make about ten thousand Model S sedans per year and
had budgeted around $130 million to achieve this goal, including engineering the car and acquiring
the manufacturing machines needed to stamp out the body parts. “One of the things Elon pushed hard
with everyone was to do as much as possible in-house,” Lloyd said. Tesla would make up for its lack
of R&D money by hiring smart people who could outwork and outthink the third parties relied on by
the rest of the automakers. “The mantra was that one great engineer will replace three medium ones,”
Lloyd said.
A small team of Tesla engineers began the process of trying to figure out the mechanical inner
workings of the Model S. Their first step in this journey took place at a Mercedes dealership where
they test drove a CLS 4-Door Coupe and an E-Class sedan. The cars had the same chassis, and the
Tesla engineers took measurements of every inch of the vehicles, studying what they liked and didn’t
like. In the end, they preferred the styling on the CLS and settled on it as their baseline for thinking
about the Model S.
After purchasing a CLS, Tesla’s engineers tore it apart. One team had reshaped the boxy,rectangular battery pack from the Roadster and made it flat. The engineers cut the floor out of the CLS
and plopped in the pack. Next they put the electronics that tied the whole system together in the trunk.
After that, they replaced the interior of the car to restore its fit and finish. Following three months of
work, Tesla had in effect built an all-electric Mercedes CLS. Tesla used the car to woo investors and
future partners like Daimler that would eventually turn to Tesla for electric powertrains in their
vehicles. Now and again, the Tesla team took the car out for drives on public roads. It weighed more
than the Roadster but was still fast and had a range of about 120 miles per charge. To perform these
joyrides-cum-tests in relative secrecy, the engineers had to weld the tips of the exhaust pipes back
onto the car to make it look like any other CLS.
It was at this time, the summer of 2008, when an artsy car lover named Franz von Holzhausen
joined Tesla. His job would be to breathe new life into the car’s early designs and, if possible, turn
the Model S into an iconic product.*
Von Holzhausen grew up in a small Connecticut town. His father worked on the design and
marketing of consumer products, and Franz treated the family basement full of markers, different kinds
of paper, and other materials as a playground for his imagination. As he grew older, von Holzhausen
drifted toward cars. He and a friend stripped down a dune-buggy motor one winter and then built it
back up, and von Holzhausen always filled the margins of his school notebooks with drawings of cars
and had pictures of cars on his bedroom walls. Applying to college, von Holzhausen decided to
follow his father’s path and enrolled in the industrial design program at Syracuse University. Then,
through a chance encounter with another designer during an internship, von Holzhausen heard about
the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. “This guy had been teaching me about car design
and this school in Los Angeles, and I got super-intrigued,” said von Holzhausen. “I went to Syracuse
for two years and then decided to transfer out to California.”
The move to Los Angeles kicked off a long and storied design career in the automotive industry.
Von Holzhausen would go on to intern in Michigan with Ford and in Europe with Volkswagen, where
he began to pick up on a mix of design sensibilities. After graduating in 1992, he started work for
Volkswagen on just about the most exciting project imaginable—a top-secret new version of the
Beetle. “It really was a magical time,” von Holzhausen said. “Only fifty people in the world knew we
were doing this project.” Von Holzhausen had a chance to work on the exterior and interior of the
vehicle, including the signature flower vase built into the dashboard. In 1997, Volkswagen launched
the “New Beetle,” and von Holzhausen saw firsthand how the look of the car captivated the public
and changed the way people felt about Volkswagen, which had suffered from woeful sales in the
United States. “It started a rebirth of the VW brand and brought design back into their mix,” he said.
Von Holzhausen spent eight years with VW, climbing the ranks of its design team and falling in
love with the car culture of Southern California. Los Angeles has long adored its cars, with the
climate lending itself to all manner of vehicles from convertibles to surfboard-toting vans. Almost all
of the major carmakers set up design studios in the city. The presence of the studios allowed von
Holzhausen to hop from VW to General Motors and Mazda, where he served as the company’s
director of design.
GM taught von Holzhausen just how nasty a big car company could become. None of the cars in
GM’s lineup really excited him, and it seemed near impossible to make a large impact on the
company’s culture. He was one member of a thousand-person design team that divvyed up the makes
of cars haphazardly without any consideration as to which person really wanted to work on whichcar. “They took all the spirit out of me,” said von Holzhausen. “I knew I didn’t want to die there.”
Mazda, by contrast, needed and wanted help. It let von Holzhausen and his team in Los Angeles put
their imprint on every car in the North American vehicle lineup and to produce a set of concept cars
that reshaped how the company approached design. As von Holzhausen put it, “We brought the zoomzoom back into the look and feel of the car.”
Von Holzhausen started a project to make Mazda’s cars more green by revaluating the types of
materials used to fabricate the seats and the fuels going into the vehicles. He had, in fact, just made an
ethanol-based concept car when, in early 2008, a friend told him that Tesla needed a chief designer.
After playing phone tag for a month with Musk’s assistant, Mary Beth Brown, to inquire about the
position, von Holzhausen finally got in touch and met Musk for an interview at the SpaceX
headquarters.
Musk instantly saw von Holzhausen, with his bouffant, trendy clothes and laid-back attitude, as a
free-spirited, creative complement and wooed him with vigor. They took a tour of the SpaceX factory
in Hawthorne and Tesla’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. Both facilities were chaotic and reeked of
start-up. Musk ramped up the charm and sold von Holzhausen on the idea that he had a chance to
shape the future of the automobile and that it made sense to leave his cushy job at a big, proven
automaker for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. “Elon and I went for a drive in the Roadster, and
everyone was checking it out,” von Holzhausen said. “I knew I could stay at Mazda for ten years and
get very comfortable or take a huge leap of faith. At Tesla, there was no history, no baggage. There
was just a vision of products that could change the world. Who wouldn’t want to be involved with
that?”
While von Holzhausen knew the risks of going to a startup, he could not have realized just how
close Tesla was to bankruptcy when he joined the company in August 2008. Musk had coaxed von
Holzhausen away from a secure job and into the jaws of death. But in many ways, this is what von
Holzhausen sought at this point in his career. Tesla did not feel as much like a car company as a bunch
of guys tinkering on a big idea. “To me, it was exciting,” he said. “It was like a garage experiment,
and it made cars cool again.” The suits were gone, and so were the veteran automotive hands dulled
by years working in the industry. In their stead, von Holzhausen found energetic geeks who didn’t
realize that what they wanted to do was borderline impossible. Musk’s presence added to the energy
and gave von Holzhausen confidence that Tesla actually could outflank much, much larger
competitors. “Elon’s mind was always way beyond the present moment,” he said. “You could see that
he was a step or three ahead of everyone else and one hundred percent committed to what we were
doing.”
Von Holzhausen had examined the drawings of the Model S left by Fisker and a clay model of the
car and had come away unimpressed. “It was a blob,” he said. “It was clear to me that the people that
had been working on this were novices.” Musk realized the same thing and tried to articulate what he
wanted. Even though the words were not precise, they were good enough to give von Holzhausen a
feel for Musk’s vision and the confidence that he could deliver on it. “I said, ‘We’re going to start
over. We’re going to work together and make this awesome.’”
To save money, the Tesla design center came to life inside the SpaceX factory. A handful of
people on von Holzhausen’s team took over one corner and put up a tent to add some separation and
secrecy to what they were doing. In the tradition of many a Musk employee, von Holzhausen had to
build his own office. He made a pilgrimage to IKEA to buy some desks and then went to an art storeto get some paper and pens.
As von Holzhausen began sketching the outside of the Model S, the Tesla engineers had started up
a project to build another electric CLS. They ripped this one down to its very core, removing all of
the body structure and then stretching the wheelbase by four inches to match up with some of the early
Model S specifications. Things began moving fast for everyone involved in the Model S project. In
the span of about three months, von Holzhausen had designed 95 percent of what people see today
with the Model S, and the engineers had started building a prototype exterior around the skeleton.
Throughout this process, von Holzhausen and Musk talked every day. Their desks were close, and
the men had a natural rapport. Musk said he wanted an aesthetic that borrowed from Aston Martin and
Porsche and some specific functions. He insisted, for example, that the car seat seven people. “It was
like ‘Holy shit, how do we pull this off in a sedan?’” von Holzhausen said. “But I understood. He had
five kids and wanted something that could be thought of as a family vehicle, and he knew other people
would have this issue.”
Musk wanted to make another statement with a huge touchscreen. This was years before the iPad
would be released. The touch-screens that people ran into now and again at airports or shopping
kiosks were for the most part terrible. But to Musk, the iPhone and all of its touch functions made it
obvious that this type of technology would soon become commonplace. He would make a giant
iPhone and have it handle most of the car’s functions. To find the right size for the screen, Musk and
von Holzhausen would sit in the skeleton car and hold up laptops of different sizes, placing them
horizontally and vertically to see what looked best. They settled on a seventeen-inch screen in a
vertical position. Drivers would tap on this screen for every task except for opening the glove box
and turning on the emergency lights—jobs required by law to be performed with physical buttons.
Since the battery pack at the base of the car would weigh so much, Musk, the designers, and the
engineers were always looking for ways to reduce the Model S’s weight in other spots. Musk opted to
solve a big chunk of this problem by making the body of the Model S out of lightweight aluminum
instead of steel. “The non-battery-pack portion of the car has to be lighter than comparable gasoline
cars, and making it all aluminum became the obvious decision,” Musk said. “The fundamental
problem was that if we didn’t make it out of aluminum the car wasn’t going to be any good.”
Musk’s word choice there—“obvious decision”—goes a long way toward explaining how he
operates. Yes, the car needed to be light, and, yes, aluminum would be an option for making that
happen. But at the time, car manufacturers in North America had almost no experience producing
aluminum body panels. Aluminum tends to tear when worked by large presses. It also develops lines
that look like stretch marks on skin and make it difficult to lay down smooth coats of paint. “In
Europe, you had some Jaguars and one Audi that were made of aluminum, but it was less than five
percent of the market,” Musk said. “In North America, there was nothing. It’s only recently that the
Ford F-150 has arrived as mostly aluminum. Before that, we were the only one.” Inside of Tesla,
attempts were repeatedly made to talk Musk out of the aluminum body, but he would not budge, seeing
it as the only rational choice. It would be up to the Tesla team to figure out how to make the aluminum
manufacturing happen. “We knew it could be done,” Musk said. “It was a question of how hard it
would be and how long it would take us to sort it out.”
Just about all of the major design choices with the Model S came with similar challenges. “When
we first talked about the touch-screen, the guys came back and said, ‘There’s nothing like that in the
automotive supply chain,’” Musk said. “I said, ‘I know. That’s because it’s never been put in afucking car before.’” Musk figured that computer manufacturers had tons of experience making
seventeen-inch laptop screens and expected them to knock out a screen for the Model S with relative
ease. “The laptops are pretty robust,” Musk said. “You can drop them and leave them out in the sun,
and they still have to work.” After contacting the laptop suppliers, Tesla’s engineers came back and
said that the temperature and vibration loads for the computers did not appear to be up to automotive
standards. Tesla’s supplier in Asia also kept pointing the carmaker to its automotive division instead
of its computing division. As Musk dug into the situation more, he discovered that the laptop screens
simply had not been tested before under the tougher automotive conditions, which included large
temperature fluctuations. When Tesla performed the tests, the electronics ended up working just fine.
Tesla also started working hand in hand with the Asian manufacturers to perfect their then-immature
capacitive-touch technology and to find ways to hide the wiring behind the screen that made the touch
technology possible. “I’m pretty sure that we ended up with the only seventeen-inch touch-screen in
the world,” Musk said. “None of the computer makers or Apple had made it work yet.”
The Tesla engineers were radical by automotive industry standards but even they had problems
fully committing to Musk’s vision. “They wanted to put in a bloody switch or a button for the lights,”
Musk said. “Why would we need a switch? When it’s dark, turn the lights on.” Next, the engineers put
up resistance to the door handles. Musk and von Holzhausen had been studying a bunch of preliminary
designs in which the handles had yet to be drawn in and started to fall in love with how clean the car
looked. They decided that the handles should only present themselves when a passenger needed to get
in the car. Right away, the engineers realized this would be a technological pain, and they completely
ignored the idea in one prototype version of the car, much to the dismay of Musk and von Holzhausen.
“This prototype had the handles pivot instead of popping out,” von Holzhausen said. “I was upset
about it, and Elon said, ‘Why the fuck is this different? We’re not doing this.’”
To crank up the pace of the Model S design, there were engineers working all day and then others
who would show up at 9 P.M. and work through the night. Both groups huddled inside of the 3,000-
square-foot tent placed on the SpaceX factory floor. Their workspace looked like a reception area at
an outdoor wedding. “The SpaceX guys were amazingly respectful and didn’t peek or ask questions,”
said Ali Javidan, one of the main engineers. As von Holzhausen delivered his specifications, the
engineers built the prototype body of the car. Every Friday afternoon, they brought what they had
made into a courtyard behind the factory where Musk would look it over and provide feedback. To
run tests on the body, the car would be loaded up with ballast to represent five people and then do
loops around the factory until it overheated or broke down.
The more von Holzhausen learned about Tesla’s financial struggles, the more he wanted the public
to see the Model S. “Things were so precarious, and I didn’t want to miss our opportunity to get this
thing finished and show it to the world,” he said. That moment came in March 2009, when, just six
months after von Holzhausen had arrived, Tesla unveiled the Model S at a press event held at
SpaceX.
Amid rocket engines and hunks of aluminum, Tesla showcased a gray Model S sedan. From a
distance, the display model looked glamorous and refined. The media reports from the day described
the car as the love child of an Aston Martin and a Maserati. In reality, the sedan barely held together.
It still had the base structure of a Mercedes CLS, although no one in the press knew that, and some of
the body panels and the hood were stuck to the frame with magnets. “They could just slide the hood
right off,” said Bruce Leak, a Tesla owner invited to attend the event. “It wasn’t really attached. Theywould put it back on and try and align it to get the fit and finish right, but then someone would push on
it, and it would move again. It was one of those Wizard of Oz, man behind the curtain moments.” A
couple of the Tesla engineers practiced test-driving the car for a couple of days leading up to the
event to make sure that they knew just how long the car would go before it overheated. While not
perfect, the display accomplished exactly what Musk had intended. It reminded people that Tesla had
a credible plan to make electric cars more mainstream and that its cars were far more ambitious than
what big-time automakers like GM and Nissan seemed to have in mind both from a design and a range
perspective.
The messy reality behind the display was that the odds of Tesla advancing the Model S from a
prop to a sellable car were infinitesimal. The company had the technical know-how and the will for
the job. It just didn’t have much money or a factory that could crank out cars by the thousands.
Building an entire car would require blanking machines that take sheets of aluminum and chop them
up into the appropriate size for doors, hoods, and body panels. Next up would be the massive
stamping machines and metal dies used to take the aluminum and bend it into precise shapes. Then
there would be dozens of robots that would aid in assembling the cars, computer-controlled milling
machines for precise metalwork, painting equipment, and a bevy of other machines for running tests. It
was an investment that would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Musk would also need to
hire thousands of workers.
As with SpaceX, Musk preferred to build as much of Tesla’s vehicles in-house as possible, but
the high costs were limiting just how much Tesla could take on. “The original plan was that we would
do final assembly,” said Diarmuid O’Connell, the vice president of business development at Tesla.
Partners would stamp out the body parts, do the welding and handle the painting, and ship everything
to Tesla, where workers would turn the parts into a whole car. Tesla proposed to build a factory to
handle this type of work first in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and then later in San Jose, California,
and then pulled back on these proposals, much to the dismay of city officials in both locales. The
public hemming and hawing around picking the factory site did little to inspire confidence in Tesla’s
ability to knock out a second car and generated the same type of negative headlines that had
surrounded the Roadster’s protracted delivery.
O’Connell had joined Tesla in 2006 to help solve some of the factory and financing issues. He
grew up near Boston in a middle-class Irish family and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from
Dartmouth College. After that, O’Connell attended the University of Virginia to get a master’s degree
in foreign policy and then Northwestern, where he got an MBA from the Kellogg School of
Management. He had fancied himself a scholar of the Soviet Union and its foreign and economic
policy and had studied these areas at UVa. “But then, in 1988 and 1989, they’re starting to close down
the Soviet Union, and, at the very least, I had a brand problem,” O’Connell said. “It started looking to
me like I was heading to a career in academia or intelligence.” It was then that O’Connell’s career
took a detour into the business world, where he became a management consultant working for
McCann Erickson Worldwide, Young & Rubicam, and Accenture, advising companies like CocaCola and AT&T.
O’Connell’s career path changed more drastically in 2001 when the planes hit the twin towers in
New York. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, O’Connell, like many people, decided to serve the
United States in any capacity that he could. In his late thirties, he had missed the window to be a
soldier and instead focused his attention on trying to get into national security work. O’Connell wentfrom office to office in Washington, D.C., looking for a job and had little luck until Lincoln
Bloomfield, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, heard him out. Bloomfield
needed someone who could help prioritize missions in the Middle East and make sure the right
people were working on the right things, and he figured that O’Connell’s management consulting
experience made him a nice fit for the job. O’Connell became Bloomfield’s chief of staff and dealt
with a wide range of charged situations, from trade negotiations to setting up an embassy in Baghdad.
After gaining security clearance, O’Connell also had access to a daily report that collected
information from intelligence and military personnel on the status of operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan. “Every morning at six A.M., the first thing to hit my desk was this overnight report that
included information on who got killed and what killed them,” O’Connell said. “I kept thinking, This
is insane. Why are we in this place? It was not just Iraq but the whole picture. Why were we so
invested in that part of the world?” The unsurprising answer that O’Connell came up with was oil.
The more O’Connell dug into the United States’ dependence on foreign oil, the more frustrated
and despondent he became. “My clients were basically the combat commanders—people in charge of
Latin America and Central Command,” he said. “As I talked with them and studied and researched, I
realized that even in peacetime, so many of our assets were employed to support the economic
pipeline around oil.” O’Connell decided that the rational thing to do for his country and for his
newborn son was to alter this equation. He looked at the wind industry and the solar industry and the
traditional automakers but came away unconvinced that what they were doing could have a radical
enough impact on the status quo. Then, while reading Businessweek, he stumbled on an article about a
start-up called Tesla Motors and went to the company’s website, which described Tesla as a place
“where we are doing things, not talking about things.” “I sent an e-mail telling them I had come from
the national security area and was really passionate about reducing our dependence on oil and figured
it was just a dead-letter type of thing,” O’Connell said. “I got an e-mail back the next day.”
Musk hired O’Connell and quickly dispatched him to Washington, D.C., to start poking around on
what types of tax credits and rebates Tesla might be able to drum up around its electric vehicles. At
the same time, O’Connell drafted an application for a Department of Energy stimulus package.* “All I
knew is that we were going to need a shitload of money to build this company,” O’Connell said. “My
view was that we needed to explore everything.” Tesla had been looking for between $100 million
and $200 million, grossly underestimating what it would take to build the Model S. “We were naïve
and learning our way in the business,” O’Connell said.
It January 2009, Tesla took over Porsche’s usual spot at the Detroit auto show, getting the space
cheap because so many other car companies had bailed out on the event. Fisker had a luxurious booth
across the hallway with wood flooring and pretty blond booth babes draped over its car. Tesla had
the Roadster, its electric powertrain, and no frills.
The technology that Tesla’s engineers displayed proved good enough to attract the attention of the
big boys. Not long after the show, Daimler voiced some interest in seeing what an electric Mercedes
A Class car might look and feel like. Daimler executives said they would visit Tesla in about a month
to discuss this proposition in detail, and the Tesla engineers decided to blow them away by producing
two prototype vehicles before the visit. When the Daimler executives saw what Tesla had done, they
ordered four thousand of Tesla’s battery packs for a fleet of test vehicles in Germany. The Tesla team
pulled off the same kind of feats for Toyota and won its business, too.
In May 2009, things started to take off for Tesla. The Model S had been unveiled, and Daimlerfollowed that by acquiring a 10 percent stake in Tesla for $50 million. The companies also formed a
strategic partnership to have Tesla provide the battery packs for one thousand of Daimler’s Smart
cars. “That money was important and went a long way back then,” said O’Connell. “It was also a
validation. Here is the company that invented the internal combustion engine, and they are investing in
us. It was a seminal moment, and I am sure it gave the guys over at the DOE the feeling that we were
real. It’s not just our scientists saying this stuff is good. It’s Mercedes freaking Benz.”
Sure enough, in January 2010, the Department of Energy struck a $465 million loan agreement
with Tesla.* The money was far more than Tesla had ever expected to get from the government. But it
still represented just a fraction of the $1 billion plus that most carmakers needed to bring a new
vehicle to market. So, while Musk and O’Connell were thrilled to get the money, they still wondered
if Tesla would be able to live up to the bargain. Tesla would need one more windfall or, perhaps, to
steal a car factory. And in May 2010, that’s more or less what it did.
General Motors and Toyota had teamed up in 1984 to build New United Motor Manufacturing
Inc., or NUMMI, on the site of a former GM assembly plant in Fremont, California, a city on the
outskirts of Silicon Valley. The companies hoped the joint facility would combine the best of
American and Japanese automaking skills and result in higher-quality, cheaper cars. The factory went
on to pump out millions of vehicles like the Chevy Nova and Toyota Corolla. Then the recession hit,
and GM found itself trying to climb out of bankruptcy. It decided to abandon the plant in 2009, and
Toyota followed right after, saying it would close down the whole facility, leaving five thousand
people without jobs.
All of a sudden, Tesla had the chance to buy a 5.3-million-square-foot plant in its backyard. Just
one month after the last Toyota Corolla went off the manufacturing line in April 2010, Tesla and
Toyota announced a partnership and transfer of the factory. Tesla agreed to pay $42 million for a large
portion of the factory (once worth $1 billion), while Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla for a 2.5
percent stake in the company. Tesla had basically secured a factory, including the massive metalstamping machines and other equipment, for free.*
The string of fortunate turns for Tesla left Musk feeling good. Just after the factory deal closed in
the summer of 2010, Tesla started the process of filing for an initial public offering. The company
obviously needed as much capital as it could get to bring the Model S to market and push forward
with its other technology projects. Tesla hoped to raise about $200 million.
For Musk, going public represented something of a Faustian bargain. Ever since the Zip2 and
PayPal days, Musk has done everything in his power to maintain absolute control over his companies.
Even if he remained the largest shareholder in Tesla, the company would be subjected to the
capricious nature of the public markets. Musk, the ultimate long-term thinker, would face constant
second-guessing from investors looking for short-term returns. Tesla would also be subject to public
scrutiny, as it would be forced to open its books for public consumption. This was bad because Musk
prefers to operate in secrecy and because Tesla’s financial situation looked awful. The company had
one product (the Roadster), had huge development costs, and had bordered on bankruptcy months
earlier. The car blog Jalopnik greeted the Tesla IPO as a Hail Mary rather than a sound fiscal move.
“For lack of a better phrase, Tesla is a money pit,” the blog wrote. “Since the company’s founding in
2003, it’s managed to incur over $290 million in losses on just $147.6 million in revenue.” Told by a
source that Tesla hoped to sell 20,000 units of the Model S per year at $58,000 a pop, Jalopnik
scoffed. “Even considering the supposed pent-up demand among environmentalists for a car like theModel S, those are ambitious goals for a small company planning to launch a niche luxury product
into a soft market. Frankly, we’re skeptical. We’ve seen how brutal and unforgiving the market can
be, and other automakers aren’t simply going to roll over and surrender that volume to Tesla.” Other
pundits concurred with this assessment.
Tesla went public on June 29, 2010, nonetheless. It raised $226 million, with the company’s
shares shooting up 41 percent that day. Investors looked past Tesla’s $55.7 million loss in 2009 and
the more than $300 million the company had spent in seven years. The IPO stood as the first for an
American carmaker since Ford went public in 1956. Competitors continued to treat Tesla like an
annoying, ankle-biting dachshund. Nissan’s CEO, Carlos Ghosn, used the event to remind people that
Tesla was but a pipsqueak and that his company had plans to pump out up to 500,000 electric cars by
2012.
Flush with funds, Musk began expanding some of the engineering teams and formalizing the
development work around the Model S. Tesla’s main offices moved from San Mateo to a larger
building in Palo Alto, and von Holzhausen expanded the design team in Los Angeles. Javidan hopped
between projects, helping develop technology for the electrified Mercedes-Benz, an electric Toyota
Rav4, and prototypes of the Model S. The Tesla team worked fast inside of a tiny lab with about 45
people knocking out 35 Rav4 test vehicles at the rate of about two cars per week. The alpha version
of the Model S, including newly stamped body parts from the Fremont factory, a revamped battery
pack, and revamped power electronics, came to life in the basement of the Palo Alto office. “The first
prototype was finished at about two A.M.,” Javidan said. “We were so excited that we drove it around
without glass, any interior, or a hood.”
A day or two later, Musk came to check out the vehicle. He jumped into the car and drove it to the
opposite end of the basement, where he could spend some time alone with it. He got out and walked
around the vehicle, and then the engineers came over to hear his take on the machine. This process
would be repeated many times in the months to come. “He would generally be positive but
constructive,” Javidan said. “We would try and get him rides whenever we could, and he might ask
for the steering to be tighter or something like that before running off to another meeting.”
About a dozen of the alpha cars were produced. A couple went to suppliers like Bosch to begin
work on the braking systems, while others were used for various tests and design tweaks. Tesla’s
executives kept the vehicles rotating on a strict schedule, giving one team two weeks for coldweather testing and then shipping that alpha car to another team right away for powertrain tuning.
“The guys from Toyota and Daimler were blown away,” Javidan said. “They might have two hundred
alpha cars and several hundred to a thousand beta cars. We were doing everything from crash tests to
the interior design with about fifteen cars. That was amazing to them.”
Tesla employees developed similar techniques to their counterparts at SpaceX for dealing with
Musk’s high demands. The savvy engineers knew better than to go into a meeting and deliver bad
news without some sort of alternative plan at the ready. “One of the scariest meetings was when we
needed to ask Elon for an extra two weeks and more money to build out another version of the Model
S,” Javidan said. “We put together a plan, stating how long things would take and what they would
cost. We told him that if he wanted the car in thirty days it would require hiring some new people, and
we presented him with a stack of resumes. You don’t tell Elon you can’t do something. That will get
you kicked out of the room. You need everything lined up. After we presented the plan, he said,
‘Okay, thanks.’ Everyone was like, ‘Holy shit, he didn’t fire you.’”There were times when Musk would overwhelm the Tesla engineers with his requests. He took a
Model S prototype home for a weekend and came back on the Monday asking for around eighty
changes. Since Musk never writes anything down, he held all the alterations in his head and would
run down the checklist week by week to see what the engineers had fixed. The same engineering rules
as those at SpaceX applied. You did what Musk asked or were prepared to burrow down into the
properties of materials to explain why something could not be done. “He always said, ‘Take it down
to the physics,’” Javidan said.
As the development of the Model S neared completion in 2012, Musk refined his requests and
dissection style. He went over the Model S with von Holzhausen every Friday at Tesla’s design
studio in Los Angeles. Von Holzhausen and his small team had moved out of the corner in the SpaceX
factory and gotten their own hangar-shaped facility near the rear of the SpaceX complex.* The
building had a few offices and then one large, wide-open area where various mock-ups of vehicles
and parts awaited inspection. During a visit I made in 2012, there was one complete Model S, a
skeletal version of the Model X—an as yet to be released SUV—and a selection of tires and hubcaps
lined up against the wall. Musk sank into the Model S driver seat and von Holzhausen climbed into
the passenger seat. Musk’s eyes darted around for a few moments and then settled onto the sun visor.
It was beige and a visible seam ran around the edge and pushed the fabric out. “It’s fish-lipped,”
Musk said. The screws attaching the visor to the car were visible as well, and Musk insisted that
every time he saw them it felt like tiny daggers were stabbing him in the eyes. The whole situation
was unacceptable. “We have to decide what is the best sun visor in the world and then do better,”
Musk said. A couple of assistants taking notes outside of the car jotted this down.
This process played out again with the Model X. This was to be Tesla’s merger of an SUV and a
minivan built off the Model S foundation. Von Holzhausen had four different versions of the vehicle’s
center console resting on the floor, so that they could be slotted in one by one and viewed by Musk.
The pair spent most of their time, however, agonizing over the middle row of seats. Each one had an
independent base so that each passenger could adjust his seat rather than moving the whole row
collectively. Musk loved the freedom this gave the passenger but grew concerned after seeing all
three seats in different positions. “The problem is that they will never be aligned and might look a
mess,” Musk said. “We have to make sure they are not too hodgy podgy.”
The idea of Musk as a design expert has long struck me as bizarre. He’s a physicist at heart and an
engineer by demeanor. So much of who Musk is says that he should fall into that Silicon Valley
stereotype of the schlubby nerd who would only know good design if he read about it in a textbook.
The truth is that there might be some of that going on with Musk, and he’s turned it into an advantage.
He’s very visual and can store things that others have deemed to look good away in his brain for
recall at any time. This process has helped Musk develop a good eye, which he’s combined with his
own sensibilities, while also refining his ability to put what he wants into words. The result is a
confident, assertive perspective that does resonate with the tastes of consumers. Like Steve Jobs
before him, Musk is able to think up things that consumers did not even know they wanted—the door
handles, the giant touch-screen—and to envision a shared point of view for all of Tesla’s products
and services. “Elon holds Tesla up as a product company,” von Holzhausen said. “He’s passionate
that you have to get the product right. I have to deliver for him and make sure it’s beautiful and
attractive.”
With the Model X, Musk again turned to his role as a dad to shape some of the flashiest designelements of the vehicle. He and von Holzhausen were walking around the floor of an auto show in
Los Angeles, and they both complained about the awkwardness of getting to the middle and back row
seats in an SUV. Parents who have felt their backs wrench while trying to angle a child and car seat
into a vehicle know this reality all too well, as does any decent-sized human who has tried to wedge
into a third row seat. “Even on a minivan, which is supposed to have more room, almost one-third of
the entry space is covered by the sliding door,” von Holzhausen said. “If you could open up the car in
a way that is unique and special, that could be a real game changer. We took that kernel of an idea
back and worked up forty or fifty design concepts to solve the problem, and I think we ended up with
one of the most radical ones.” The Model X has what Musk coined as “falcon-wing doors.” They’re
hinged versions of the gull-wing doors found on some high-end cars like the DeLorean. The doors go
up and then flop over in a constrained enough way that the Model X won’t rub up against a car parked
close to it or hit the ceiling in a garage. The end result is that a parent can plop a child in the secondrow passenger seat without needing to bend over or twist at all.
When Tesla’s engineers first heard about the falcon-wing doors, they cringed. Here was Musk
with another crazy ask. “Everyone tried to come up with an excuse as to why we couldn’t do it,”
Javidan said. “You can’t put it in the garage. It won’t work with things like skis. Then, Elon took a
demo model to his house and showed us that the doors opened. Everyone is mumbling, ‘Yeah, in a
fifteen-million-dollar house, the doors will open just fine.’” Like the controversial door handles on
the Model S, the Model X’s doors have become one of its most striking features and the thing
consumers talk about the most. “I was one of the first people to test it out with a kid’s car seat,”
Javidan said. “We have a minivan, and you have to be a contortionist to get the seat into the middle
row. Compared to that, the Model X was so easy. If it’s a gimmick, it’s a gimmick that works.”
During my 2012 visit to the design studio, Tesla had a number of competitors’ vehicles in the
parking lot nearby, and Musk made sure to demonstrate the limitations of their seating compared to the
Model X. He tried with honest effort to sit in the third row of an Acura SUV, but, even though the car
claimed to have room for seven, Musk’s knees were pressed up to his chin, and he never really fit
into the seat. “That’s like a midget cave,” he said. “Anyone can make a car big on the outside. The
trick is to make it big on the inside.” Musk went from one rival’s car to the next, illuminating the
vehicles’ flaws for me and von Holzhausen. “It’s good to get a sense for just how bad the other cars
are,” he said.
When these statements fly out of Musk’s mouth, it’s momentarily shocking. Here’s a guy who
needed nine years to produce about three thousand cars ridiculing automakers that build millions of
vehicles every year. In that context, his ribbing comes off as absurd.
Musk, though, approaches everything from a Platonic perspective. As he sees it, all of the design
and technology choices should be directed toward the goal of making a car as close to perfect as
possible. To the extent that rival automakers haven’t, that’s what Musk is judging. It’s almost a binary
experience for him. Either you’re trying to make something spectacular with no compromises or
you’re not. And if you’re not, Musk considers you a failure. This position can look unreasonable or
foolish to outsiders, but the philosophy works for Musk and constantly pushes him and those around
him to their limits.
On June 22, 2012, Tesla invited all of its employees, some select customers, and the press to its
factory in Fremont to watch as the first Model S sedans were taken home. Depending on which of the
many promised delivery dates you pick, the Model S was anywhere from eighteen months to two-plusyears late. Some of the delays were a result of Musk’s requests for exotic technologies that needed to
be invented. Other delays were simply a function of this still quite young automaker learning how to
produce an immaculate luxury vehicle and needing to go through the trial and error tied to becoming a
more mature, more refined company.
The outsiders were blown away by their first glimpse of the Tesla factory. Musk had T-E-S-L-A
painted in enormous black letters on the side of the building so that people driving by on the freeway,
or flying above for that matter, were made well aware of the company’s presence. The inside of the
factory, once dressed in the dark, dingy tones of General Motors and Toyota, had taken on the Musk
aesthetic. The floors received a white epoxy, the walls and beams were painted white, the thirty-foot
tall stamping machines were white, and then much of the other machinery, like the teams of the robots,
had been painted red, making the place look like an industrial version of Santa Claus’s workshop.
Just as he did at SpaceX, Musk placed the desks of his engineers right on the factory floor, where they
worked in an area cordoned off by rudimentary cubicle dividers. Musk had a desk in this area as
well.*
The Model S launch event took place in a section of the factory where they finish off the cars.
There’s a part of the floor with various grooves and bumps that the cars pass over, as technicians
listen for any rattles. There’s also a chamber where water can be sprayed at high pressure onto the
car to check for leaks. For the very last inspection, the Model S cruises onto a raised platform made
out of bamboo, which, when coupled with lots of LED lighting, is meant to provide an abundant
amount of contrast so that people can spot flaws on the body. For the few first months that the Model
S came off the line, Musk went to this bamboo stage to inspect every vehicle. “He was down on all
fours looking up under the wheel well,” said Steve Jurvetson, the investor and Tesla board member.
Hundreds of people had gathered around this stage to watch as the first dozen or so cars were
presented to their owners. Many of the employees were factory workers who had once been part of
the autoworkers’ union, lost their jobs when the NUMMI plant closed, and were now back at work
again, making the car of the future. They waved American flags and wore red, white, and blue visors.
A handful of the workers cried as the Model S sedans were lined up on the stage. Even Musk’s most
cynical critics would have softened for a moment while watching the proceedings. Say what you will
about Tesla receiving government money or hyping up the promise of the electric car, it was trying to
do something big and different, and people were getting hired by the thousands as a result. With
machines humming in the background, Musk gave a brief speech and then handed the owners their
keys. They drove off the bamboo platform and out the factory doors, while the Tesla employees
provided a standing ovation.
Just four weeks earlier, SpaceX had flown cargo to the International Space Station and had its
capsule returned to Earth—firsts all around for a private company. That feat coupled with the launch
of the Model S led to a rapid transformation in the way the world outside of Silicon Valley perceived
Musk. The guy who was always promising, promising, promising was doing—and doing spectacular
things. “I may have been optimistic with respect to the timing on some of these things, but I didn’t
over-promise on the outcome,” Musk told me during an interview after the Model S launch. “I have
done everything I said I was going to do.”
Musk did not have Riley around to celebrate with and share in this run of good fortune. They had
divorced, and Musk had begun to think about dating again, if he could find the time. Even with this
turmoil in his personal life, however, Musk had reached a point of calm that he had not felt in manyyears. “My main emotion is that there is a bit of weight off my shoulders,” he said at the time. Musk
took his boys to Maui to meet up with Kimbal and other relatives, marking his first real vacation in a
number of years.
It was right after this holiday that Musk let me have the first substantial glimpse into his life. Skin
still peeling off his sunburnt arms, Musk met with me at the Tesla and SpaceX headquarters, at the
Tesla design studio, and at a Beverley Hills screening of a documentary he had helped sponsor. The
film, Baseball in the Time of Cholera, was good but grim and explored a cholera outbreak in Haiti. It
turned out that Musk had visited Haiti the previous Christmas, filling his jet with toys and MacBook
Airs for an orphanage. Bryn Mooser, the codirector of the film, told me that during a barbecue Musk
had taught the kids how to fire off model rockets and then later went to visit a village deeper in the
jungle by traveling in a dugout canoe. After the screening, Musk and I hung out on the street for a bit
away from the crowd. I noted aloud that everyone wants to make him out as the Tony Stark character
but that he didn’t really exude that “playboy drinking scotch while zooming through Afghanistan in an
army convoy” vibe. He fired back, pointing to the Haitian canoe ride. “I got wasted, too, on some
drink they call the Zombie,” Musk said. He smiled and then invited me to grab some drinks across the
street at Mr. Chow to celebrate the movie. All seemed to be going well for Musk, and he savored the
moment.
This restful period did not last long and soon enough Tesla’s battle for survival resumed. The
company could only produce about ten sedans per week at the outset and had thousands of back
orders that it needed to fulfill. Short sellers, those investors who bet a company’s share price will
fall, had taken huge positions in Tesla, making it the most shorted stock out of one hundred of the
largest companies listed on the NASDAQ exchange. The naysayers expected numerous Model S
flaws to crop up and undermine the enthusiasm for the car, to the point that people started canceling
their orders in bulk. There were also huge doubts that Tesla could ramp up production in a meaningful
way and do so profitably. In October 2012, the presidential hopeful Mitt Romney dubbed Tesla “a
loser,” while slagging off a couple of other government-backed green technology companies (the
solar panel maker Solyndra and Fisker) during a debate with Barack Obama.14
While the doubters placed huge wagers on Tesla’s impending failure, Musk’s bluster mode
engaged. He began talking about Tesla’s goals to become the most profitable major automobile maker
in the world, with better margins than BMW. Then, in September 2012, he unveiled something that
shocked both Tesla critics and proponents alike. Tesla had secretly been building the first leg of a
network of charging stations. The company disclosed the location of six stations in California,
Nevada, and Arizona and promised that hundreds more would be on the way. Tesla intended to build
a global charging network that would let Model S owners making long drives pull off the highway
and recharge very quickly. And they would be able to do so for free. In fact, Musk insisted that Tesla
owners would soon be able to travel across the United States without spending a penny on fuel.
Model S drivers would have no trouble finding these stations, not only because the cars’ onboard
computers would guide them to the nearest one but because Musk and von Holzhausen had designed
giant red and white monoliths to herald the appearance of the stations.
The Supercharging stations, as Tesla called them, represented a huge investment for the strapped
company. An argument could easily be made that spending money on this sort of thing at such a
precarious moment in the Model S and Tesla’s history was somewhere between daft and batshit crazy.
Surely Musk did not have the gall to try to revamp the very idea of the automobile and build an energynetwork at the same time with a budget equivalent to what Ford and ExxonMobil spend on their
annual holiday parties. But that was the exact plan. Musk, Straubel, and others inside Tesla had
mapped out this all-or-nothing play long ago and built certain features into the Model S with the
Superchargers in mind.*
While the arrival of the Model S and the charging network garnered Tesla a ton of headlines, it
remained unclear if the positive press and good vibes would last. Serious trade-offs had been made
as Tesla rushed to get the Model S to market. The car had some spectacular, novel features. But
everyone inside of the company knew that as far as luxury sedans went, the Model S did not match up
feature to feature with cars from BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The first few thousand Model S cars, for
example, would ship without the parking sensors and radar-assisted cruise control common on other
high-end cars. “It was either hire a team of fifty people right away to make one of these things happen
or implement things as best and as fast as you could,” Javidan said.
The subpar fit and finish also proved hard to explain. The early adopters could tolerate a
windshield wiper going haywire for a couple of days, but they wanted to see seats and visors that met
the $100,000 price tag. While Tesla did its best to source the highest-quality materials, it struggled at
times to convince the top suppliers to take the company seriously.15 “People were very suspect that
we would deliver one thousand Model Ss,” said von Holzhausen. “It was frustrating because we had
the drive internally to make the car perfect but could not get the same commitment externally. With
something like the visor, we ended up having to go to a third-rate supplier and then work on fixing the
situation after the car had already started shipping.” The cosmetic issues, though, were minor
compared to a tumultuous set of internal circumstances, revealed in detail here for the first time, that
threatened to bankrupt the company once again.
Musk had hired George Blankenship, a former Apple executive, to run its stores and servicecenter operations. At Apple, Blankenship worked just a couple of doors down from Steve Jobs and
received credit for building much of the Apple Store strategy. When Tesla first hired Blankenship, the
press and public were atwitter, anticipating that’d he do something spectacular and at odds with the
traditions of the automotive industry.
Blankenship did some of that. He expanded Tesla’s number of stores throughout the world and
imbued them with that Apple Store vibe. Along with showcasing the Model S, the Tesla stores sold
hoodies and hats and had areas in the back where kids would find crayons and Tesla coloring books.
Blankenship gave me a tour of the Tesla store on Santana Row, the glitzy shopping center in San Jose.
He came off as a warm, grandfatherly sort who saw Tesla as his chance to make a difference. “The
typical dealer wants to sell you a car on the spot to clear inventory off his lot,” Blankenship said.
“The goal here is to develop a relationship with Tesla and electric vehicles.” Tesla, he said, wanted
to turn the Model S into more than a car. Ideally it would be an object of desire just like the iPod and
iPhone. Blankenship noted that Tesla had more than ten thousand reservations for the Model S at the
time, the vast majority of which had arrived without the customers test-driving the car. A lot of this
early interest resulted from the aura surrounding Musk, who Blankenship said came off as similar to
Jobs but with a toned-down control-freak vibe. “This is the first place I have worked that is going to
change the world,” Blankenship said, taking a jab at the sometimes trivial nature of Apple’s gadgets.
While Musk and Blankenship got along at first, their relationship fell apart during the latter stages
of 2012. Tesla did have a large number of reservations in which people put down $5,000 for the right
to buy a Model S and get in the purchase queue. But the company had struggled to turn thesereservations into actual sales. The reasons behind this problem remain unclear. It may have been that
the complaints about the interior and the early kinks mentioned on the Tesla forums and message
boards were causing concerns. Tesla also lacked financing options to soften the blow of buying a
$100,000 car, while uncertainty surrounded the resale market for the Model S. You might end up with
the car of the future or you might spend six figures on a dud with a battery pack that loses its capacity,
and with no secondary buyer. Tesla’s service centers at the time were also terrible. The early cars
were unreliable and customers were being sent in droves to centers unprepared to handle the volume.
Many prospective Tesla owners likely wanted to hang out on the sidelines for a bit longer to make
sure that the company would remain viable. As Musk put it, “The word of mouth on the car sucked.”
By the middle of February 2013, Tesla had fallen into a crisis state. If it could not convert its
reservations to purchases quickly, its factory would sit idle, costing the company vast amounts of
money. And if anyone caught wind of the factory slowdown, Tesla’s shares would likely plummet,
prospective owners would become even more cautious, and the short sellers would win. The severity
of this problem had been hidden from Musk, but once he learned about it, he acted in his signature allor-nothing fashion. Musk pulled people from recruiting, the design studio, engineering, finance, and
wherever else he could find them and ordered them to get on the phone, call people with reservations,
and close deals. “If we don’t deliver these cars, we are fucked,” Musk told the employees. “So, I
don’t care what job you were doing. Your new job is delivering cars.” He placed Jerome Guillen, a
former Daimler executive, in charge of fixing the service issues. Musk fired senior leaders whom he
deemed subpar performers and promoted a flood of junior people who had been doing above-average
work. He also made an announcement personally guaranteeing the resale price of the Model S.
Customers would be able to resell their cars for the average going rate of similar luxury sedans with
Musk putting his billions behind this pledge. And then Musk tried to orchestrate the ultimate fail-safe
for Tesla just in case his maneuvers did not work.
During the first week of April, Musk reached out to his friend Larry Page at Google. According to
people familiar with their discussion, Musk voiced his concerns about Tesla’s ability to survive the
next few weeks. Not only were customers failing to convert their reservations to orders at the rate
Musk hoped, but existing customers had also started to defer their orders as they heard about
upcoming features and new color choices. The situation got so bad that Tesla had to shut down its
factory. Publicly, Tesla said it needed to conduct maintenance on the factory, which was technically
true, although the company would have soldiered on had the orders been closing as expected. Musk
explained all of this to Page and then struck a handshake deal for Google to acquire Tesla.
While Musk did not want to sell, the deal seemed like the only viable course for Tesla’s future.
Musk’s biggest fear about an acquisition was that the new owner would not see Tesla’s goals through
to their conclusion. He wanted to make sure that the company would end up producing a mass-market
electric vehicle. Musk proposed terms under which he would remain in control of Tesla for eight
years or until it started pumping out a mass-market car. Musk also asked for access to $5 billion in
capital for factory expansions. Some of Google’s lawyers were put off by these demands, but Musk
and Page continued to talk about the deal. Given Tesla’s value at the time, it was thought that Google
would need to pay about $6 billion for the company.
As Musk, Page, and Google’s lawyers debated the parameters of an acquisition, a miracle
happened. The five hundred or so people whom Musk had turned into car salesmen quickly sold a
huge volume of cars. Tesla, which only had a couple weeks of cash left in the bank, moved enoughcars in the span of about fourteen days to end up with a blowout first fiscal quarter. Tesla stunned
Wall Street on May 8, 2013, by posting its first-ever profit as a public company—$11 million—on
$562 million in sales. It delivered 4,900 Model S sedans during the period. This announcement sent
Tesla’s shares soaring from about $30 a share to $130 per share in July. Just a couple of weeks after
revealing the first-quarter results, Tesla paid off its $465 million loan from the government early and
with interest. Tesla suddenly appeared to have vast cash reserves at its disposal, and the short sellers
were forced to take massive losses. The solid performance of the stock increased consumers’
confidence, creating a virtuous circle for Tesla. With cars selling and Tesla’s value rising, the deal
with Google was no longer necessary, and Tesla had become too expensive to buy. The talks with
Google ended.*
What transpired next was the Summer of Musk. Musk put his public relations staff on high alert,
telling them that he wanted to try to have one Tesla announcement per week. The company never quite
lived up to that pace, but it did issue statement after statement. Musk held a series of press
conferences that addressed financing for the Model S, the construction of more charging stations, and
the opening of more retail stores. During one announcement, Musk noted that Tesla’s charging stations
were solar-powered and had batteries on-site to store extra juice. “I was joking that even if there’s
some zombie apocalypse, you’ll still be able to travel throughout the country using the Tesla
Supercharger system,” Musk said, setting the bar very high for CEOs at other automakers. But the
biggest event by far was held in Los Angeles, where Tesla unveiled another secret feature of the
Model S.
In June 2013, Tesla cleared the prototype vehicles out of its Los Angeles design studio and
invited Tesla owners and the media for a flashy evening soiree. Hundreds of people showed up,
driving their pricey Model S sedans through the grungy streets of Hawthorne and parking in between
the design studio and the SpaceX factory. The studio had been converted into a lounge. The lighting
was dim, and the floor had been covered in AstroTurf and tiered to make plateaus where people
could mingle or plop down on couches. Women in tight black dresses cruised through the crowd,
serving drinks. Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” played on the sound system. A stage had been built at the
front of the room, but before Musk ascended it he mingled with the masses. It was clear that he had
become a rock star for Tesla owners—every bit the equivalent of Steve Jobs for the Apple faithful.
People surrounded him and asked to take pictures. Meanwhile, Straubel stood off to the side, often
totally alone.
After people had a couple of drinks, Musk fought through the crowd to the front of the room,
where old TV commercials projected onto a screen above the stage showed families stopping by
Esso and Chevron stations. The kids were so happy to see the Esso tiger mascot. “Gas is a weird
thing to love,” Musk said. “Honestly.” That’s when he brought a Model S up onstage. A hole opened
up in the floor beneath the car. It had been possible all along, Musk said, to replace the battery pack
underneath the Model S in a matter of seconds—the company just hadn’t told anyone about this. Tesla
would now start adding battery swapping at its charging stations as a quicker option to recharging.
Someone could drive right over a pit where a robot would take off the car’s battery pack and install a
new one in ninety seconds, at a cost equivalent to filling up with a tank of gas. “The only decision that
you have to make when you come to one of our Tesla stations is do you prefer faster or free,” Musk
said.*
In the months that followed, a couple of events threatened to derail the Summer of Musk. The NewYork Times penned a withering review of the car and its charging stations, and a couple of the Model
S sedans caught fire after being involved in collisions. Disobeying conventional public relations
wisdom, Musk went after the reporter, using data pulled from the car to undermine the reviewer’s
claims. Musk penned the feisty rebuttal himself, while on vacation in Aspen with Kimbal, and friend
and Tesla board member Antonio Gracias. “At some other company, it would be a public relations
group putting something like this together,” Gracias said. “Elon felt like it was the most important
problem facing Tesla at the time and that’s always what he deals with and how he prioritizes. It could
kill the car and represented an existential threat against the business. Have there been moments where
his unconventional style in these types of situations has made me cringe? Yes. But I trust that it will
work out in the end.” Musk applied a similar approach to dealing with the fires by declaring the
Model S the safest car in America in a press release and adding a titanium underbody shield and
aluminum plates to the vehicle to deflect and destroy debris and keep the battery pack safe.16
The fires, the occasional bad review—none of this had any effect on Tesla’s sales or share price.
Musk’s star shone brighter and brighter as Tesla’s market value ballooned to about half that of GM
and Ford.
Tesla held another press event in October 2014 that cemented Musk’s place as the new titan of the
auto industry. Musk unveiled a supercharged version of the Model S with two motors—one in the
front and one in the back. It could go zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds. The company had turned a sedan into
a supercar. “It’s like taking off from a carrier deck,” Musk said. “It’s just bananas.” Musk also
unveiled a new suite of software for the Model S that gave it autopilot functions. The car had radar to
detect objects and warn of possible collisions and could guide itself via GPS. “Later, you will be
able to summon the car,” Musk said. “It will come to wherever you are. There’s also something else I
would like to do. Many of our engineers will be hearing this in real time. I would like the charge
connector to plug itself into the car, sort of like an articulating snake. I think we will probably do
something like that.”
Thousands of people waited in line for hours to see Musk demonstrate this technology. Musk
cracked jokes during the presentation and played off the crowd’s enthusiasm. The man who had been
awkward in front of media during the PayPal years had developed a unique, slick stagecraft. A
woman standing next to me in the crowd went weak in the knees when Musk first took the stage. A
man to my other side said he wanted a Model X and had just offered $15,000 to a friend to move up
on the reservation list, so that he could end up with model No. 700. The enthusiasm coupled with
Musk’s ability to generate attention was emblematic of just how far the little automaker and its
eccentric CEO had come. Rival car companies would kill to receive such interest and had basically
been left dumbfounded as Tesla snuck up on them and delivered more than they had ever imagined
possible.
As the Model S fever gripped Silicon Valley, I visited Ford’s small research and development lab
in Palo Alto. The head of the lab at the time was a ponytailed, sandal-wearing engineer named T. J.
Giuli, who felt very jealous of Tesla. Inside of every Ford were dozens of computing systems made
by different companies that all had to speak to each other and work as one. It was a mess of
complexity that had evolved over time, and simplifying the situation would prove near impossible at
this point, especially for a company like Ford, which needed to pump out hundreds of thousands of
cars per year and could not afford to stop and reboot. Tesla, by contrast, got to start from scratch and
make its own software the focus of the Model S. Giuli would have loved the same opportunity.“Software is in many ways the heart of the new vehicle experience,” he said. “From the powertrain to
the warning chimes in the car, you’re using software to create an expressive and pleasing
environment. The level of integration that the software has into the rest of the Model S is really
impressive. Tesla is a benchmark for what we do here.” Not long after this chat, Giuli left Ford to
become an engineer at a stealth start-up.
There was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla down. But that didn’t stop
executives from trying to be difficult whenever possible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its thirdgeneration car the Model E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E, and X—another
playful Musk gag. But Ford’s then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked Tesla from using Model E, with the
threat of a lawsuit. “So I call up Mulally and I was like, ‘Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you
really going to do a Model E?’” Musk said. “And I’m not sure which is worse. You know? Like it
would actually make more sense if they’re just fucking with us because if they actually come out with
a Model E at this point, and we’ve got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with the Model E,
it’s going to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred years ago, nobody
thinks of ‘Model’ as being a Ford thing anymore. So it would just feel like they stole it. Like why did
you go steal Tesla’s E? Like you’re some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort
of Sesame Street robber. And he was like, ‘No, no, we’re definitely going to use it.’ And I was like,
‘Oh, I don’t think that’s such a good idea because people are going to be confused because it’s not
going to make sense. People aren’t used to Ford having Model something these days. It’s usually
called like the Ford Fusion.’ And he was like, no, his guys really want to use that. That’s terrible.”
After that, Tesla registered the trademark for Model Y as another joke. “In fact, Ford called us up
deadpan and said, ‘We see you’ve registered Model Y. Is that what you’re going to use instead of the
Model E?’” Musk said. “I’m like, ‘No, it’s a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does that spell?’ But trademark
law is a dry profession it turns out.”*
What Musk had done that the rival automakers missed or didn’t have the means to combat was
turn Tesla into a lifestyle. It did not just sell someone a car. It sold them an image, a feeling they were
tapping into the future, a relationship. Apple did the same thing decades ago with the Mac and then
again with the iPod and iPhone. Even those who were not religious about their affiliation to Apple
were sucked into its universe once they bought the hardware and downloaded software like iTunes.
This sort of relationship is hard to pull off if you don’t control as much of the lifestyle as
possible. PC makers that farmed their software out to Microsoft, their chips to Intel, and their design
to Asia could never make machines as beautiful and as complete as Apple’s. They also could not
respond in time as Apple took this expertise to new areas and hooked people on its applications.
You can see Musk’s embrace of the car as lifestyle in Tesla’s abandonment of model years. Tesla
does not designate cars as being 2014s or 2015s, and it also doesn’t have “all the 2014s in stock must
go, go, go and make room for the new cars” sales. It produces the best Model S it can at the time, and
that’s what the customer receives. This means that Tesla does not develop and hold on to a bunch of
new features over the course of the year and then unleash them in a new model all at once. It adds
features one by one to the manufacturing line when they’re ready. Some customers may be frustrated
to miss out on a feature here and there. Tesla, however, manages to deliver most of the upgrades as
software updates that everyone gets, providing current Model S owners with pleasant surprises.
For the Model S owner, the all-electric lifestyle translates into a less hassled existence. Instead of
going to the gas station, you just plug the car in at night, a rhythm familiar to anyone with asmartphone. The car will start charging right away or the owner can tap into the Model S’s software
and schedule charging to take place late at night, when the cheapest electricity rates are available.
Tesla owners not only dodge gas stations; they mostly get to skip out on visits to mechanics. A
traditional vehicle needs oil and transmission fluid changes to deal with all the friction and wear and
tear produced by its thousands of moving parts. The simpler electric car design eliminates this type of
maintenance. Both the Roadster and the Model S also take advantage of what’s known as regenerative
braking, which extends the life of the brakes. During stop-and-go situations, the Tesla will brake by
kicking the motor into reverse via software and slowing down the wheels instead of using brake pads
and friction to clamp them down. The Tesla motor generates electricity during this process and
funnels it back to the batteries, which is why electric cars get better mileage in city traffic. Tesla still
recommends that owners bring in the Model S once a year for a checkup but that’s mostly to give the
vehicle a once-over and make sure that none of the components seems to be wearing down
prematurely.
Even Tesla’s approach to maintenance is philosophically different from that of the traditional
automotive industry. Most car dealers make the majority of their profits from servicing cars. They
treat vehicles like a subscription service, expecting people to visit their service centers multiple
times a year for many years. This is the main reason dealerships have fought to block Tesla from
selling its cars directly to consumers.* “The ultimate goal is to never have to bring your car back in
after you buy it,” said Javidan. The dealers charge more than independent mechanics but give people
the peace of mind that their car is being worked on by a specialist for a particular make of vehicle.
Tesla makes its profits off the initial sale of the car and then from some optional software services. “I
got the number ten Model S,” said Konstantin Othmer,17 the Silicon Valley software whiz and
entrepreneur. “It was an awesome car, but it had just about every issue you might have read about in
the forums. They would fix all these things and decided to trailer the car back to the shop so that they
didn’t add any miles to it. Then I went in for a one-year service, and they spruced up everything so
that the car was better than new. It was surrounded by velvet ropes in the service center. It was just
beautiful.”
Tesla’s model isn’t just about being an affront to the way carmakers and dealers do business. It’s a
more subtle play on how electric cars represent a new way to think of automobiles. All car
companies will soon follow Tesla’s lead and offer some form of over-the-air updates to their
vehicles. The practicality and scope of their updates will be limited, however. “You just can’t do an
over-the-air sparkplug change or replacement of the timing belt,” said Javidan. “With a gas car, you
have to get under the hood at some point and that forces you back to the dealership anyway. There’s
no real incentive for Mercedes to say, ‘You don’t need to bring the car in,’ because it’s not true.”
Tesla also has the edge of having designed so many of the key components for its cars in-house,
including the software running throughout the vehicle. “If Daimler wants to change the way a gauge
looks, it has to contact a supplier half a world away and then wait for a series of approvals,” Javidan
said. “It would take them a year to change the way the ‘P’ on the instrument panel looks. At Tesla, if
Elon decides he wants a picture of a bunny rabbit on every gauge for Easter, he can have that done in
a couple of hours.”*
As Tesla turned into a star of modern American industry, its closest rivals were obliterated.
Fisker Automotive filed for bankruptcy and was bought by a Chinese auto parts company in 2014.
One of its main investors was Ray Lane, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Lane had cost Kleiner Perkins a chance to invest in Tesla and then backed Fisker—a disastrous move
that tarnished the firm’s brand and Lane’s reputation. Better Place was another start-up that enjoyed
more hype than Fisker and Tesla put together and raised close to $1 billion to build electric cars and
battery-swapping stations.18 The company never produced much of anything and declared bankruptcy
in 2013.
The guys like Straubel who had been at Tesla since the beginning are quick to remind people that
the chance to build an awesome electric car had been there all along. “It’s not really like there was a
rush to this idea, and we got there first,” Straubel said. “It is frequently forgotten in hindsight that
people thought this was the shittiest business opportunity on the planet. The venture capitalists were
all running for the hills.” What separated Tesla from the competition was the willingness to charge
after its vision without compromise, a complete commitment to execute to Musk’s standards.11THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY OF ELON MUSK
THE RIVE BROTHERS USED TO BE LIKE A TECHNOLOGY GANG. In the late 1990s, they
would jump on skateboards and zip around the streets of Santa Cruz, knocking on the doors of
businesses and asking if they needed any help managing their computing systems. The young men, who
had all grown up in South Africa with their cousin Elon Musk, soon decided there must be an easier
way to hawk their technology smarts than going door-to-door. They wrote some software that allowed
them to take control of their clients’ systems from afar and to automate many of the standard tasks that
companies required, such as installing updates for applications. The software became the basis of a
new company called Everdream, and the brothers promoted their technology in some compelling
ways. Billboards went up around Silicon Valley in which Lyndon Rive, a buff underwater hockey
player,* stood naked with his pants around his ankles, while holding a computer in front of his crotch.
Up above his photo, the tagline for the ad read, “Don’t get caught with your systems down.”
By 2004, Lyndon and his brothers, Peter and Russ, wanted a new challenge—something that not
only made them money but, as Lyndon put it, “something that made us feel good every single day.”
Near the end of the summer that year, Lyndon rented an RV and set out with Musk for the Black Rock
desert and the madness of Burning Man. The men used to go on adventures all the time when they
were kids and looked forward to the long drive as a way to catch up and brainstorm about their
businesses. Musk knew that Lyndon and his brothers were angling for something big. While driving,
Musk turned to Lyndon and suggested that he look into the solar energy market. Musk had studied it a
bit and thought there were some opportunities that others had missed. “He said it was a good place to
get into,” Lyndon recalled.
After arriving at Burning Man, Musk, a regular at the event, and his family went through their
standard routines. They set up camp and prepped their art car for a drive. This year, they had cut the
roof off a small car, elevated the steering wheel, shifted it to the right so that it was placed near the
middle of the vehicle, and replaced the seats with a couch. Musk took a lot of pleasure in driving the
funky creation.19 “Elon likes to see the rawness of people there,” said Bill Lee, his longtime friend.
“It’s his version of camping. He wants to go and drive the art cars and see installations and the great
light shows. He dances a lot.” Musk put on a display of strength and determination at the event as
well. There was a wooden pole perhaps thirty feet high with a dancing platform at the top. Dozens of
people tried and failed to climb it, and then Musk gave it a go. “His technique was very awkward,
and he should not have succeeded,” said Lyndon. “But he hugged it and just inched up and inched up
until he reached the top.”
Musk and the Rives left Burning Man enthused. The Rives decided to become experts on the solar
industry and find the opportunity in the market. They spent two years studying solar technology and
the dynamics of the business, reading research reports, interviewing people, and attending
conferences along the way. It was during the Solar Power International conference that the Rive
brothers really hit on what their business model might be. Only about two thousand* people showedup for the event, and they all fit into a couple of hotel conference rooms for presentations and panels.
During one open discussion session, representatives from a handful of the world’s largest solar
installers were sitting onstage, and the moderator asked what they were doing to make solar panels
more affordable for consumers. “They all gave the same answer,” Lyndon said. “They said, ‘We’re
waiting for the cost of the panels to drop.’ None of them were taking ownership of the problem.”
At the time, it was not easy for consumers to get solar panels on their houses. You had to be very
proactive, acquiring the panels and finding someone else to install them. The consumer paid up front
and had to make an educated guess as to whether or not his or her house even got enough sunshine to
make the ordeal worthwhile. On top of all this, people were reluctant to buy panels, knowing that the
next year’s models would be more efficient.
The Rives decided to make buying into the solar proposition much simpler and formed a company
called SolarCity in 2006. Unlike other companies, they would not manufacture their own solar panels.
Instead they would buy them and then do just about everything else in-house. They built software for
analyzing a customer’s current energy bill and the position of their house and the amount of sunlight it
typically received to determine if solar made sense for the property. They built up their own teams to
install the solar panels. And they created a financing system in which the customer did not need to pay
anything up front for the panels. The consumer leased the panels over a number of years at a fixed
monthly rate. Consumers got a lower bill overall, they were no longer subject to the constantly rising
rates of typical utilities, and, if they sold their house, they could pass the contract to the new owner.
At the end of the lease, the homeowner could also upgrade to new, more efficient panels. Musk had
helped his cousins come up with this structure and become the company’s chairman and its largest
shareholder, owning about a third of SolarCity.
Six years later, SolarCity had become the largest installer of solar panels in the country. The
company had lived up to its initial goals and made installing the panels painless. Rivals were rushing
to mimic its business model. SolarCity had benefited along the way from a collapse in the price of
solar panels, which occurred after Chinese panel manufacturers flooded the market with product. It
had also expanded its business from consumers to businesses with companies like Intel, Walgreens,
and Wal-Mart signing up for large installations. In 2012, SolarCity went public and its shares soared
higher in the months that followed. By 2014, SolarCity was valued at close to $7 billion.
During the entire period of SolarCity’s growth, Silicon Valley had dumped huge amounts of
money into green technology companies with mostly disastrous results. There were the automotive
flubs like Fisker and Better Place, and Solyndra, the solar cell maker that conservatives loved to hold
up as a cautionary tale of government spending and cronyism run amok. Some of the most famous
venture capitalists in history, like John Doerr and Vinod Khosla, were ripped apart by the local and
national press for their failed green investments. The story was almost always the same. People had
thrown money at green technology because it seemed like the right thing to do, not because it made
business sense. From new kinds of energy storage systems to electric cars and solar panels, the
technology never quite lived up to its billing and required too much government funding and too many
incentives to create a viable market. Much of this criticism was fair. It’s just that there was this Elon
Musk guy hanging around who seemed to have figured something out that everyone else had missed.
“We had a blanket rule against investing in clean-tech companies for about a decade,” said Peter
Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist at Founders Fund. “On the macro level, we were
right because clean tech as a sector was quite bad. But on the micro level, it looks like Elon has thetwo most successful clean-tech companies in the U.S. We would rather explain his success as being a
fluke. There’s the whole Iron Man thing in which he’s presented as a cartoonish businessman—this
very unusual animal at the zoo. But there is now a degree to which you have to ask whether his
success is an indictment on the rest of us who have been working on much more incremental things.
To the extent that the world still doubts Elon, I think it’s a reflection on the insanity of the world and
not on the supposed insanity of Elon.”
SolarCity, like the rest of Musk’s ventures, did not represent a business opportunity so much as it
represented a worldview. Musk had decided long ago—in his very rational manner—that solar made
sense. Enough solar energy hits the Earth’s surface in about an hour to equal a year’s worth of
worldwide energy consumption from all sources put together.20 Improvements in the efficiency of
solar panels have been happening at a steady clip. If solar is destined to be mankind’s preferred
energy source in the future, then this future ought to be brought about as quickly as possible.
Starting in 2014, SolarCity began to make the full extent of its ambitions more obvious. First, the
company began selling energy storage systems. These units were built through a partnership with
Tesla Motors. Battery packs were manufactured at the Tesla factory and stacked inside refrigeratorsized metal cases. Businesses and consumers could purchase these storage systems to augment their
solar panel arrays. Once they were charged up, the battery units could be used to help large customers
get through the night or during unexpected outages. Customers could also pull from the batteries
instead of the grid during peak energy use periods, when utilities tend to tack on extra charges. While
SolarCity rolled the storage units out in a modest, experimental fashion, the company expects most of
its customers to buy the systems in the years ahead to smooth out the solar experience and help people
and businesses leave the electrical grid altogether.
Then, in June 2014, SolarCity acquired a solar cell maker called Silevo for $200 million. This
deal marked a huge shift in strategy. SolarCity would no longer buy its solar panels. It would make
them at a factory in New York State. Silevo’s cells were said to be 18.5 percent efficient at turning
light into energy, compared to 14.5 percent for most cells, and the expectations were that the company
could reach 24 percent efficiency with the right manufacturing techniques. Buying, rather than
manufacturing, solar panels had been one of SolarCity’s great advantages. It could capitalize on the
glut in the solar cell market and avoid the large capital expenditures tied to building and running
factories. With 110,000 customers, however, SolarCity had started to consume so many solar panels
that it needed to ensure a consistent supply and price. “We are currently installing more solar than
most of the companies are manufacturing,” said Peter Rive, the cofounder and chief technology officer
at SolarCity. “If we do the manufacturing ourselves and take advantage of some different technology,
our costs will be lower—and this business has always been about lowering the costs.”
After adding the leases, the storage units, and the solar cell manufacturing together, it became
clear to close observers of SolarCity that the company had morphed into something resembling a
utility. It had built out a network of solar systems all under its control and managed by the company’s
software. By the end of 2015, SolarCity expects to have installed 2 gigawatts’ worth of solar panels,
producing 2.8 terawatt-hours of electricity per year. “This would put us on a path to fulfill our goal to
become one of the largest suppliers of electricity in the United States,” the company said after
announcing these figures in a quarterly earnings statement. The reality is that SolarCity accounts for a
tiny fraction of the United States’ annual energy consumption and has a long way to go to become a
major supplier of electricity in the country. There can, however, be little doubt that Musk intends forthe company to be a dominant force in the solar industry and in the energy industry overall.
What’s more, SolarCity is a key part of what can be thought of as the unified field theory of Musk.
Each one of his businesses is interconnected in the short term and the long term. Tesla makes battery
packs that SolarCity can then sell to end customers. SolarCity supplies Tesla’s charging stations with
solar panels, helping Tesla to provide free recharging to its drivers. Newly minted Model S owners
regularly opt to begin living the Musk Lifestyle and outfit their homes with solar panels. Tesla and
SpaceX help each other as well. They exchange knowledge around materials, manufacturing
techniques, and the intricacies of operating factories that build so much stuff from the ground up.
For most of their histories, SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX have been the clear underdogs in their
respective markets and gone to war against deep-pocketed, entrenched competitors. The solar,
automotive, and aerospace industries remain larded down by regulation and bureaucracy, which
favors incumbents. To people in these industries Musk came off as a wide-eyed technologist who
could be easily dismissed and ridiculed and who, as a competitor, fell somewhere on the spectrum
between annoying and full of shit. The incumbents did their usual thing using their connections in
Washington to make life as miserable as possible on all three of Musk’s companies, and they were
pretty good at it.
As of 2012, Musk Co. turned into a real threat, and it became harder to go at SolarCity, Tesla, or
SpaceX as individual companies. Musk’s star power had surged and washed over all three ventures
at the same time. When Tesla’s shares jumped, quite often SolarCity’s did, too. Similar optimistic
feelings accompanied successful SpaceX launches. They proved Musk knew how to accomplish the
most difficult of things, and investors seemed to buy in more to the risks Musk took with his other
enterprises. The executives and lobbyists of aerospace, energy, and automotive companies were
suddenly going up against a rising star of big business—an industrialist celebrity. Some of Musk’s
opponents started to fear being on the wrong side of history or at least the wrong side of his glow.
Others began playing really dirty.
Musk has spent years buttering up the Democrats. He’s visited the White House several times and
has the ear of President Obama. Musk, however, is not a blind loyalist. He first and foremost backs
the beliefs behind Musk Co. and then uses any pragmatic means at his disposal to advance his cause.
Musk plays the part of the ruthless industrialist with a fierce capitalist streak better than most
Republicans and has the credentials to back it up and earn support. The politicians in states like
Alabama looking to protect some factory jobs for Lockheed or in New Jersey trying to help out the
automobile dealership lobby now have to contend with a guy who has an employment and
manufacturing empire spread across the entire United States. As of this writing, SpaceX had a factory
in Los Angeles, a rocket test facility in central Texas, and had just started construction on a spaceport
in South Texas. (SpaceX does a lot of business at existing launch sites in California and Florida, as
well.) Tesla had its car factory in Silicon Valley, the design center in Los Angeles, and had started
construction on a battery factory in Nevada. (Politicians from Nevada, Texas, California, New
Mexico, and Arizona threw themselves at Musk over the battery factory, with Nevada ultimately
winning the business by offering Tesla $1.4 billion in incentives. This event confirmed not only
Musk’s soaring celebrity but also his unmatched ability to raise funds.) SolarCity has created
thousands of white- and blue-collar clean-tech jobs, and it will create manufacturing jobs at the solar
panel factory that’s being built in Buffalo, New York. All together, Musk Co. employed about fifteen
thousand people at the end of 2014. Far from stopping there, the plan for Musk Co. calls for tens ofthousands of more jobs to be created on the back of ever more ambitious products.
Tesla’s primary focus throughout 2015 will be bringing the Model X to market. Musk expects the
SUV to sell at least as well as the Model S and wants Tesla’s factories to be capable of making
100,000 cars per year by the end of 2015 to keep up with demand for both vehicles. The major
downside accompanying the Model X is its price. The SUV will start at the same lofty prices as the
Model S, which limits the potential customer base. The hope, though, is that the Model X turns into
the luxury vehicle of choice for families and solidifies the Tesla brand’s connection with women.
Musk has pledged that the Supercharger network, service centers, and the battery-swap stations will
be built out even more in 2015 to greet the arrival of the new vehicle. Beyond the Model X, Tesla has
started work on the second version of the Roadster, talked about making a truck, and, in all
seriousness, has begun modeling a type of submarine car that could transition from road to water.
Musk paid $1 million for the Lotus Esprit that Roger Moore drove underwater in The Spy Who Loved
Me and wants to prove that such a vehicle can be done. “Maybe we’ll make two or three, but it
wouldn’t be more than that,” Musk told the Independent newspaper. “I think the market for submarine
cars is quite small.”
At the opposite end of the sales spectrum, or so Musk hopes, will be Tesla’s third-generation car,
or the Model 3. Due out in 2017, this four-door car would come in around $35,000 and be the real
measure of Tesla’s impact on the world. The company hopes to sell hundreds of thousands of the
Model 3 and make electric cars truly mainstream. For comparison, BMW sells about 300,000 Minis
and 500,000 of its BMW 3 Series vehicles per year. Tesla would look to match those figures. “I think
Tesla is going to make a lot of cars,” Musk said. “If we continue on the current growth rate, I think
Tesla will be one of the most valuable companies in the world.”
Tesla already consumes a huge portion of the world’s lithium ion battery supply and will need far
more batteries to produce the Model 3. This is why, in 2014, Musk announced plans to build what he
dubbed the Gigafactory, or the world’s largest lithium ion manufacturing facility. Each Gigafactory
will employ about 6,500 people and help Tesla meet a variety of goals. It should first allow Tesla to
keep up with the battery demand created by its cars and the storage units sold by SolarCity. Tesla also
expects to be able to lower the costs of its batteries while improving their energy density. It will
build the Gigafactory in conjunction with longtime battery partner Panasonic, but it will be Tesla that
is running the factory and fine-tuning its operations. According to Straubel, the battery packs coming
out of the Gigafactory should be dramatically cheaper and better than the ones built today, allowing
Tesla not only to hit the $35,000 price target for the Model 3 but also to pave the way for electric
vehicles with 500-plus miles of range.
If Tesla actually can deliver an affordable car with 500 miles of range, it will have built what
many people in the auto industry insisted for years was impossible. To do that while also constructing
a worldwide network of free charging stations, revamping the way cars are sold, and revolutionizing
automotive technology would be an exceptional feat in the history of capitalism.
In early 2014, Tesla raised $2 billion by selling bonds. Tesla’s ability to raise money from eager
investors was a newfound luxury. Tesla had bordered on bankruptcy for much of its existence and
been one major technical gaffe from obsolescence at all times. The money coupled with Tesla’s stillrising share price and strong sales has put the company in a position to open lots of new stores and
service centers while advancing its manufacturing capabilities. “We don’t necessarily need all of the
money for the Gigafactory right now, but I decided to raise it in advance because you never knowwhen there will be some bloody meltdown,” Musk said. “There could be external factors or there
could be some unexpected recall and then suddenly we need to raise money on top of dealing with
that. I feel a bit like my grandmother. She lived through the Great Depression and some real hard
times. Once you’ve been through that, it stays with you for a long time. I’m not sure it ever leaves
really. So, I do feel joy now, but there’s still that nagging feeling that it might all go away. Even later
in life when my grandmother knew there was really no possibility of her going hungry, she always had
this thing about food. With Tesla, I decided to raise a huge amount of money just in case something
terrible happens.”
Musk felt optimistic enough about Tesla’s future to talk to me about some of his more whimsical
plans. He hopes to redesign the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto, a change employees would
welcome. The building, with its tiny, 1980s-era lobby and a kitchen that can barely handle a few
people making cereal21 at the same time, has none of the perks of a typical Silicon Valley darling. “I
think our Tesla headquarters looks like crap,” Musk said. “We’re going to spruce things up. Not to
sort of the Google level. You have to be like making money hand over fist in order to be able to spend
money the way that Google does. But we’re going to make our headquarters much nicer and put in a
restaurant.” Naturally, Musk had ideas for some mechanical enhancements as well. “Everybody
around here has slides in their lobbies,” he said. “I’m actually wondering about putting in a roller
coaster—like a functional roller coaster at the factory in Fremont. You’d get in, and it would take you
around factory but also up and down. Who else has a roller coaster? I’m thinking about doing that
with SpaceX, too. That one might be even bigger since SpaceX has like ten buildings now. It would
probably be really expensive, but I like the idea of it.”
What’s fascinating is that Musk remains willing to lose it all. He doesn’t want to build just one
Gigafactory but several. And he needs these facilities to be built quickly and flawlessly, so that
they’re cranking out massive quantities of batteries right as the Model 3 arrives. If need be, Musk will
build a second Gigafactory to compete with the Nevada site and place his own employees in
competition with each other in a race to make the batteries first. “We’re not really trying to sort of
yank anyone’s chain here,” Musk said. “It’s just like this thing needs to be completed on time. If we
suddenly find that we’re leveling the ground and laying the foundation and we’re on a bloody Indian
burial ground, then fuck. We can’t say, ‘Oh shit. Let’s go back to the other place that we were thinking
about and get a six-month reset.’ Six months for this factory is a huge deal. Do the basic math and it’s
more than a billion dollars a month in lost revenue,* assuming we use it to capacity. From a different
standpoint, if we spend all the money to prepare the car factory in Fremont to triple the volume from
150,000 per year to 450,000 or 500,000 cars and hire and train all the people, and we’re just sitting
there waiting for the factory to come on line, we’d be burning money like it was going out of fashion.
I think that could kill the company.
“A six-month offset would be like, like Gallipoli. You have to make sure you charge right after the
bombardment. Don’t fucking sit around for two hours so that the Turks can go back in the trenches.
Timing is important. We have to do everything we can to minimize the timing risk.”
What Musk struggles to fathom is why other automakers with deeper pockets aren’t making
similar moves. At a minimum, Tesla seems to have influenced consumers and the auto industry enough
for there to be an expected surge in demand for electric vehicles. “I think we have moved the needle
for almost every car company,” Musk said. “Just the twenty-two thousand cars we sold in 2013 had a
highly leveraged effect in pushing the industry toward sustainable technology.” It’s true that the supplyfor lithium ion batteries is already constrained, and Tesla looks like the only company addressing the
problem in a meaningful way.
“The competitors are all sort of pooh-poohing the Gigafactory,” Musk said. “They think it’s a
stupid idea, that the battery supplier should just go build something like that. But I know all the
suppliers, and I can tell you that they don’t like the idea of spending several billion dollars on a
battery factory. You’ve got a chicken-and-egg problem where the car companies are not going to
commit to a giant volume because they’re not sure you can sell enough electric cars. So, I know we
can’t get enough lithium ion batteries unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is
building this thing.”
There’s the potential that Tesla is setting itself up to capitalize on a situation like the one Apple
found itself in when it first introduced the iPhone. Apple’s rivals spent the initial year after the
iPhone’s release dismissing the product. Once it became clear Apple had a hit, the competitors had to
catch up. Even with the device right in their hands, it took companies like HTC and Samsung years to
produce anything comparable. Other once-great companies like Nokia and BlackBerry didn’t
withstand the shock. If, and it’s a big if, Tesla’s Model 3 turned into a massive hit—the thing that
everyone with enough money wanted because buying something else would just be paying for the past
—then the rival automakers would be in a terrible bind. Most of the car companies dabbling in
electric vehicles continue to buy bulky, off-the-shelf batteries rather than developing their own
technology. No matter how much they wanted to respond to the Model 3, the automakers would need
years to come up with a real challenger and even then they might not have a ready supply of batteries
for their vehicles.
“I think it is going to be a bit like that,” Musk said. “When will the first non-Tesla Gigafactory get
built? Probably no sooner than six years from now. The big car companies are so derivative. They
want to see it work somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward. They’re
probably more like seven years away. But I hope I’m wrong.”
Musk speaks about the cars, solar panels, and batteries with such passion that it’s easy to forget
they are more or less sideline projects. He believes in the technologies to the extent that he thinks
they’re the right things to pursue for the betterment of mankind. They’ve also brought him fame and
fortune. Musk’s ultimate goal, though, remains turning humans into an interplanetary species. This may
sound silly to some, but there can be no doubt that this is Musk’s raison d’être. Musk has decided that
man’s survival depends on setting up another colony on another planet and that he should dedicate his
life to making this happen.
Musk is now quite rich on paper. He was worth about $10 billion at the time of this writing. When
he started SpaceX more than a decade ago, however, he had far less capital at his disposal. He didn’t
have the fuck-you money of a Jeff Bezos, who handed his space company Blue Origin a kingly pile of
cash and asked it to make Bezos’s dreams come true. If Musk wanted to get to Mars, he would have to
earn it by building SpaceX into a real business. This all seems to have worked in Musk’s favor.
SpaceX has learned to make cheap and effective rockets and to push the limits of aerospace
technology.
In the near term, SpaceX will begin testing its ability to take people into space. It wants to
perform a manned test flight by 2016 and to fly astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA
the next year. The company will also likely make a major move into building and selling satellites,
which would mark an expansion into one of the most lucrative parts of the aerospace business. Alongwith these efforts, SpaceX has been testing the Falcon Heavy—its giant rocket capable of flying the
biggest payloads in the world—and its reusable-rocket technology. In early 2015, SpaceX almost
managed to land the first stage of its rocket on a platform in the ocean. Once it succeeds, it will begin
performing tests on land.
In 2014, SpaceX also began construction on its own spaceport in South Texas. It has acquired
dozens of acres where it plans to construct a modern rocket launch facility unlike anything the world
has seen. Musk wants to automate a great deal of the launch process, so that the rockets can be
refueled, stood up, and fired on their own with computers handling the safety procedures. SpaceX
wants to fly rockets several times a month for its business, and having its own spaceport should help
speed up such capabilities. Getting to Mars will require an even more impressive set of skills and
technology.
“We need to figure out how to launch multiple times a day,” Musk said. “The thing that’s important
in the long run is establishing a self-sustaining base on Mars. In order for that to work—in order to
have a self-sustaining city on Mars—there would need to be millions of tons of equipment and
probably millions of people. So how many launches is that? Well, if you send up 100 people at a
time, which is a lot to go on such a long journey, you’d need to do 10,000 flights to get to a million
people. So 10,000 flights over what period of time? Given that you can only really depart for Mars
once every two years, that means you would need like forty or fifty years.
“And then I think for each flight that departs to Mars you want to sort of launch the spacecraft into
orbit and then have it be in a parking orbit and refuel its tanks with propellant. Essentially, the
spacecraft would use a bunch of its propellant to get to orbit, but then you send up a tanker spacecraft
to fill up the propellant tanks of the spacecraft so that it can depart for Mars at high speed and can do
so and get there in three months instead of six months and with a large payload. I don’t have a
detailed plan for Mars but I know of something at least that would work, which is sort of this allmethane system with a big booster, a spacecraft, and a tanker potentially. I think SpaceX will have
developed a booster and spaceship in the 2025 time frame capable of taking large quantities of
people and cargo to Mars.
“The thing that’s important is to reach an economic threshold around the cost per person for a trip
to Mars. If it costs $1 billion per person, there will be no Mars colony. At around $1 million or
$500,000 per person, I think it’s highly likely that there will be a self-sustaining Martian colony.
There will be enough people interested who will sell their stuff on Earth and move. It’s not about
tourism. It’s like people coming to America back in the New World days. You move, get a job there,
and make things work. If you solve the transport problem, it’s not that hard to make a pressurized
transparent greenhouse to live in. But if you can’t get there in the first place, it doesn’t matter.
“Eventually, you’d need to heat Mars up if you want it to be an Earthlike planet, and I don’t have a
plan for that. That would take a long time in the best of circumstances. It would probably take, I don’t
know, somewhere between a century and a millennium. There’s zero chance of it being terraformed
and Earthlike in my lifetime. Not zero, but 0.001 percent chance, and you would have to take real
drastic measures with Mars.”*
Musk spent months pacing around his home in Los Angeles late at night thinking about these plans
for Mars and bouncing them off Riley, whom he remarried near the end of 2012.* “I mean, there
aren’t that many people you can talk to about this sort of thing,” Musk said. These chats included
Musk daydreaming aloud about becoming the first man to set foot on the Red Planet. “He definitelywants to be the first man on Mars,” Riley said. “I have begged him not to be.” Perhaps Musk enjoys
teasing his wife or maybe he’s playing coy, but he denied this ambition during one of our late-night
chats. “I would only be on the first trip to Mars if I was confident that SpaceX would be fine if I die,”
he said. “I’d like to go, but I don’t have to go. The point is not about me visiting Mars but about
enabling large numbers of people to go to the planet.” Musk may not even go into space. He does not
plan to participate in SpaceX’s upcoming human test flights. “I don’t think that would be wise,” he
said. “It would be like the head of Boeing being a test pilot for a new plane. It’s not the right thing for
SpaceX or the future of space exploration. I might be on there if it’s been flying for three or four
years. Honestly, if I never go to space, that will be okay. The point is to maximize the probable life
span of humanity.”
It’s difficult to gauge just how seriously the average person takes Musk when he talks like this. A
few years ago, most people would have lumped him into the category of people who hype up jet
packs and robots and whatever else Silicon Valley decided to fixate on for the moment. Then Musk
filed away one accomplishment after another, transforming himself from big talker to one of Silicon
Valley’s most revered doers. Thiel has watched Musk go through this maturation—from the driven but
insecure CEO of PayPal to a confident CEO who commands the respect of thousands. “I think there
are ways he has dramatically improved over time,” said Thiel. Most impressive to Thiel has been
Musk’s ability to find bright, ambitious people and lure them to his companies. “He has the most
talented people in the aerospace industry working for him, and the same case can be made for Tesla,
where, if you’re a talented mechanical engineer who likes building cars, then you’re going to Tesla
because it’s probably the only company in the U.S. where you can do interesting new things. Both
companies were designed with this vision of motivating a critical mass of talented people to work on
inspiring things.” Thiel thinks Musk’s goal of getting humans to Mars should be taken seriously and
believes it gives the public hope. Not everyone will identify with the mission but the fact that there’s
someone out there pushing exploration and our technical abilities to their limits is important. “The
goal of sending a man to Mars is so much more inspiring than what other people are trying to do in
space,” Thiel said. “It’s this going-back-to-the-future idea. There’s been this long wind-down of the
space program, and people have abandoned the optimistic visions of the future that we had in the
early 1970s. SpaceX shows there is a way toward bringing back that future. There’s great value in
what Elon is doing.”
The true believers came out in full force in August 2013 when Musk unveiled something called
the Hyperloop. Billed as a new mode of transportation, this machine was a large-scale pneumatic
tube like the ones used to send mail around offices. Musk proposed linking cities like Los Angeles
and San Francisco via an elevated version of this kind of tube that would transport people and cars in
pods. Similar ideas had been proposed before, but Musk’s creation had some unique elements. He
called for the tube to run under low pressure and for the pods to float on a bed of air produced by skis
at their base. Each pod would be thrust forward by an electromagnetic pulse, and motors placed
throughout the tube would give the pods added boosts as needed. These mechanisms could keep the
pods going at 800 mph, allowing someone to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about thirty
minutes. The whole thing would, of course, be solar-powered and aimed at linking cities less than a
thousand miles apart. “It makes sense for things like L.A. to San Francisco, New York to D.C., New
York to Boston,” Musk said at the time. “Over one thousand miles, the tube cost starts to become
prohibitive, and you don’t want tubes every which way. You don’t want to live in Tube Land.”Musk had been thinking about the Hyperloop for a number of months, describing it to friends in
private. The first time he talked about it to anyone outside of his inner circle was during one of our
interviews. Musk told me that the idea originated out of his hatred for California’s proposed highspeed rail system. “The sixty-billion-dollar bullet train they’re proposing in California would be the
slowest bullet train in the world at the highest cost per mile,” Musk said. “They’re going for records
in all the wrong ways.” California’s high-speed rail is meant to allow people to go from Los Angeles
to San Francisco in about two and a half hours upon its completion in—wait for it—2029. It takes
about an hour to fly between the cities today and five hours to drive, placing the train right in the zone
of mediocrity, which particularly gnawed at Musk. He insisted the Hyperloop would cost about $6
billion to $10 billion, go faster than a plane, and let people drive their cars onto a pod and drive out
into a new city.
At the time, it seemed that Musk had dished out the Hyperloop proposal just to make the public
and legislators rethink the high-speed train. He didn’t actually intend to build the thing. It was more
that he wanted to show people that more creative ideas were out there for things that might actually
solve problems and push the state forward. With any luck, the high-speed rail would be canceled.
Musk said as much to me during a series of e-mails and phone calls leading up to the announcement.
“Down the road, I might fund or advise on a Hyperloop project, but right now I can’t take my eye off
the ball at either SpaceX or Tesla,” he wrote.
Musk’s tune, however, started to change after he released the paper detailing the Hyperloop.
Bloomberg Businessweek had the first story on it, and the magazine’s Web server began melting down
as people stormed the website to read about the invention. Twitter went nuts as well. About an hour
after Musk released the information, he held a conference call to talk about the Hyperloop, and
somewhere in between our numerous earlier chats and that moment, he’d decided to build the thing,
telling reporters that he would consider making at least a prototype to prove that the technology could
work. Some people had their fun with all of this. “Billionaire unveils imaginary space train,” teased
Valleywag. “We love Elon Musk’s nutso determination—there was certainly a time when electric cars
and private space flight seemed silly, too. But what’s sillier is treating this as anything other than a
very rich man’s wild imagination.” Unlike its early Tesla-bashing days, Valleywag was now the
minority voice. People seemed mainly to believe Musk could do it. The depth to which people
believed it, I think, surprised Musk and forced him to commit to the prototype. In a weird lifeimitating-art moment, Musk really had become the closest thing the world had to Tony Stark, and he
could not let his adoring public down.
Shortly after the release of the Hyperloop plans, Shervin Pishevar, an investor and friend of
Musk’s, brought the detailed specifications for the technology with him during a ninety-minute
meeting with President Obama at the White House. “The president fell in love with the idea,”
Pishevar said. The president’s staff studied the documents and arranged a one-on-one with Musk and
Obama in April 2014. Since then, Pishevar, Kevin Brogan, and others, have formed a company called
Hyperloop Technologies Inc. with the hopes of building the first leg of the Hyperloop between Los
Angeles and Las Vegas. In theory, people would be able to hop between the two cities in about ten
minutes. Nevada senator Harry Reid has been briefed on the idea as well, and efforts are under way
to buy the land rights alongside Interstate 15 that would make the high-speed transport possible.
For employees like Gwynne Shotwell and J. B. Straubel, working with Musk means helping
develop these sorts of wonderful technologies in relative obscurity. They’re the steady hands that willforever be expected to stay in the shadows. Shotwell has been a consistent presence at SpaceX
almost since day one, pushing the company forward and suppressing her ego to ensure that Musk gets
all the attention he desires. If you’re Shotwell and truly believe in the cause of sending people to
Mars, then the mission takes precedence over personal desires. Straubel, likewise, has been the
constant at Tesla—a go-between whom other employees could rely on to carry messages to Musk, and
the guy who knows everything about the cars. Despite his stature at the company, Straubel was one of
several longtime employees who confessed they were nervous to speak with me on the record. Musk
likes to be the guy talking on his companies’ behalf and comes down hard on even his most loyal
executives if they say something deemed to be out of line with Musk’s views or with what he wants
the public to think. Straubel has dedicated himself to making electric cars and didn’t want some dumb
reporter wrecking his life’s work. “I try really hard to back away and put my ego aside,” Straubel
said. “Elon is incredibly difficult to work for, but it’s mostly because he’s so passionate. He can be
impatient and say, ‘God damn it! This is what we have to do!’ and some people will get shell-shocked
and catatonic. It seems like people can get afraid of him and paralyzed in a weird way. I try to help
everyone to understand what his goals and visions are, and then I have a bunch of my own goals, too,
and make sure we’re in synch. Then, I try and go back and make sure the company is aligned.
Ultimately, Elon is the boss. He has driven this thing with his blood, sweat, and tears. He has risked
more than anyone else. I respect the hell out of what he has done. It just could not work without Elon.
In my view, he has earned the right to be the front person for this thing.”
The rank-and-file employees tend to describe Musk in more mixed ways. They revere his drive
and respect how demanding he can be. They also think he can be hard to the point of mean and come
off as capricious. The employees want to be close to Musk, but they also fear that he’ll suddenly
change his mind about something and that every interaction with him is an opportunity to be fired.
“Elon’s worst trait by far, in my opinion, is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection,” said one
former employee. “Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a
piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on
their toes and scared; maybe he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable
degree. What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition: used for a specific
purpose until exhausted and discarded.”
The communications departments of SpaceX and Tesla have witnessed the latter forms of
behavior more than any other group of employees. Musk has burned through public relations staffers
with comical efficiency. He tends to take on a lot of the communications work himself, writing news
releases and contacting the press as he sees fit. Quite often, Musk does not let his communications
staff in on his agenda. Ahead of the Hyperloop announcement, for example, his representatives were
sending me e-mails to find out the time and date for the press conference. On other occasions,
reporters have received an alert about a teleconference with Musk just minutes before it started. This
was not a function of the PR people being incompetent in getting word of the event out. The truth was
that Musk had only let them know about his plans a couple of minutes in advance, and they were
scrambling to catch up to his whims. When Musk does delegate work to the communications staff,
they’re expected to jump in without missing a beat and to execute at the highest level. Some of this
staff, operating under this mix of pressure and surprise, only lasted between a few weeks and a few
months. A few others have hung on for a couple of years before burning out or being fired.
The granddaddy example of Musk’s seemingly callous interoffice style occurred in early 2014when he fired Mary Beth Brown. To describe her as a loyal executive assistant would be grossly
inadequate. Brown often felt like an extension of Musk—the one being who crossed over into all of
his worlds. For more than a decade, she gave up her life for Musk, traipsing back and forth between
Los Angeles and Silicon Valley every week, while working late into the night and on weekends.
Brown went to Musk and asked that she be compensated on par with SpaceX’s top executives, since
she was handling so much of Musk’s scheduling across two companies, doing public relations work
and often making business decisions. Musk replied that Brown should take a couple of weeks off, and
he would take on her duties and gauge how hard they were. When Brown returned, Musk let her know
that he didn’t need her anymore, and he asked Shotwell’s assistant to begin scheduling his meetings.
Brown, still loyal and hurt, didn’t want to discuss any of this with me. Musk said that she had become
too comfortable speaking on his behalf and that, frankly, she needed a life. Other people grumbled that
Brown and Riley clashed and that this was the root cause of Brown’s ouster.* (Brown declined to be
interviewed for this book, despite several requests.)
Whatever the case, the optics of the situation were terrible. Tony Stark doesn’t fire Pepper Potts.
He adores her and takes care of her for life. She’s the only person he can really trust—the one who
has been there through everything. That Musk was willing to let Brown go and in such an
unceremonious fashion struck people inside SpaceX and Tesla as scandalous and as the ultimate
confirmation of his cruel stoicism. The tale of Brown’s departure became part of the lore around
Musk’s lack of empathy. It got bundled up into the stories of Musk dressing employees down in
legendary fashion with vicious barb after vicious barb. People also linked this type of behavior to
Musk’s other quirky traits. He’s been known to obsess over typos in e-mails to the point that he could
not see past the errors and read the actual content of the messages. Even in social settings, Musk might
get up from the dinner table without a word of explanation to head outside and look at the stars,
simply because he’s not willing to suffer fools or small talk. After adding up this behavior, dozens of
people expressed to me their conclusion that Musk sits somewhere on the autism spectrum and that he
has trouble considering other people’s emotions and caring about their well-being.
There’s a tendency, especially in Silicon Valley, to label people who are a bit different or quirky
as autistic or afflicted with Asperger’s syndrome. It’s armchair psychology for conditions that can be
inherently funky to diagnose or even codify. To slap this label on Musk feels ill-informed and too
easy.
Musk acts differently with his closest friends and family than he does with employees, even those
who have worked alongside him for a long time. Among his inner circle, Musk is warm, funny, and
deeply emotional.* He might not engage in the standard chitchat, asking a friend how his kids are
doing, but he would do everything in his considerable power to help that friend if his child were sick
or in trouble. He will protect those close to him at all costs and, when deemed necessary, seek to
destroy those who have wronged him or his friends.
Musk’s behavior matches up much more closely with someone who is described by
neuropsychologists as profoundly gifted. These are people who in childhood exhibit exceptional
intellectual depth and max out IQ tests. It’s not uncommon for these children to look out into the world
and find flaws—glitches in the system—and construct logical paths in their minds to fix them. For
Musk, the call to ensure that mankind is a multiplanetary species partly stems from a life richly
influenced by science fiction and technology. Equally it’s a moral imperative that dates back to his
childhood. In some form, this has forever been his mandate.Each facet of Musk’s life might be an attempt to soothe a type of existential depression that seems
to gnaw at his every fiber. He sees man as self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The
people who suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in the way of all
of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as people. It’s more that he feels pained by
their mistakes, which have consigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is
a symptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he’s the only one who really grasps the urgency of his
mission. He’s less sensitive and less tolerant than other people because the stakes are so high.
Employees need to help solve the problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out
of the way.
Musk has been pretty up front about these tendencies. He’s implored people to understand that
he’s not chasing momentary opportunities in the business world. He’s trying to solve problems that
have been consuming him for decades. During our conversations, Musk went back to this very point
over and over again, making sure to emphasize just how long he’d thought about electric cars and
space. The same patterns are visible in his actions as well. When Musk announced in 2014 that Tesla
would open-source all of its patents, analysts tried to decide whether this was a publicity stunt or if it
hid an ulterior motive or a catch. But the decision was a straightforward one for Musk. He wants
people to make and buy electric cars. Man’s future, as he sees it, depends on this. If open-sourcing
Tesla’s patents means other companies can build electric cars more easily, then that is good for
mankind, and the ideas should be free. The cynic will scoff at this, and understandably so. Musk,
however, has been programmed to behave this way and tends to be sincere when explaining his
thinking—almost to a fault.
The people who get closest to Musk are the ones who learn to relate to this mode of thinking.22
They’re the ones who can identify with his vision yet challenge him intellectually to complete it.
When he asked me during one of our dinners if I thought he was insane, it was a test of sorts. We had
talked enough that he knew I was interested in what he was doing. He had started to trust me and open
up but wanted to make sure—one final time—that I truly grasped the importance of his quest. Many of
his closest friends have passed much grander, more demanding tests. They’ve invested in his
companies. They’ve defended him against critics. They helped him keep the wolves at bay during
2008. They’ve proven their loyalty and their commitment to his cause.
People in the technology industry have tended to liken Musk’s drive and the scope of his ambition
to that of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. “Elon has that deep appreciation for technology, the no-holdsbarred attitude of a visionary, and that determination to go after long-term things that they both had,”
said Edward Jung, a child prodigy who worked for Jobs and Gates and ended up as Microsoft’s chief
software architect. “And he has that consumer sensibility of Steve along with the ability to hire good
people outside of his own comfort areas that’s more like Bill. You almost wish that Bill and Steve
had a genetically engineered love child and, who knows, maybe we should genotype Elon to see if
that’s what happened.” Steve Jurvetson, the venture capitalist who has invested in SpaceX, Tesla, and
SolarCity, worked for Jobs, and knows Gates well, also described Musk as an upgraded mix of the
two. “Like Jobs, Elon does not tolerate C or D players,” said Jurvetson. “But I’d say he’s nicer than
Jobs and a bit more refined than Bill Gates.”*
But the more you know about Musk, the harder it becomes to place him among his peers. Jobs is
another CEO who ran two, large industry-changing companies—Apple and Pixar. But that’s where the
practical similarities between the two men end. Jobs dedicated far more of his energy to Apple thanPixar, unlike Musk, who has poured equal energy into both companies, while saving whatever was
left over for SolarCity. Jobs was also legendary for his attention to detail. No one, however, would
suggest that his reach extended down as far as Musk’s into overseeing so much of the companies’ dayto-day operations. Musk’s approach has its limitations. He’s less artful with marketing and media
strategy. Musk does not rehearse his presentations or polish speeches. He wings most of the
announcements from Tesla and SpaceX. He’ll also fire off some major bit of news on a Friday
afternoon when it’s likely to get lost as reporters head home for the weekend, simply because that’s
when he finished writing the press release or wanted to move on to something else. Jobs, by contrast,
treated every presentation and media moment as precious. Musk simply does not have the luxury to
work that way. “I don’t have days to practice,” he said. “I’ve got to give impromptu talks, and the
results may vary.”
As for whether Musk is leading the technology industry to new heights like Gates and Jobs, the
professional pundits remain mixed. One camp holds that SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX offer little in
the way of real hope for an industry that could use some blockbuster innovations. For the other camp,
Musk is the real deal and the brightest shining star of what they see as a coming revolution in
technology.
The economist Tyler Cowen—who has earned some measure of fame in recent years for his
insightful writings about the state of the technology industry and his ideas on where it may go—falls
into that first camp. In The Great Stagnation, Cowen bemoaned the lack of big technological
advances and argued that the American economy has slowed and wages have been depressed as a
result. “In a figurative sense, the American economy has enjoyed lots of low-hanging fruit since at
least the seventeenth century, whether it be free land, lots of immigrant labor, or powerful new
technologies,” he wrote. “Yet during the last forty years, that low-hanging fruit started disappearing,
and we started pretending it was still there. We have failed to recognize that we are at a technological
plateau and the trees are more bare than we would like to think. That’s it. That is what has gone
wrong.”
In his next book, Average Is Over, Cowen predicted an unromantic future in which a great divide
had occurred between the Haves and the Have Nots. In Cowen’s future, huge gains in artificial
intelligence will lead to the elimination of many of today’s high-employment lines of work. The
people who thrive in this environment will be very bright and able to complement the machines and
team effectively with them. As for the unemployed masses? Well, many of them will eventually find
jobs going to work for the Haves, who will employ teams of nannies, housekeepers, and gardeners. If
anything Musk is doing might alter the course of mankind toward a rosier future, Cowen can’t find it.
Coming up with true breakthrough ideas is much harder today than in the past, according to Cowen,
because we’ve already mined the bulk of the big discoveries. During a lunch in Virginia, Cowen
described Musk not as a genius inventor but as an attention seeker, and not a terribly good one at that.
“I don’t think a lot of people care about getting to Mars,” he said. “And it seems like a very expensive
way to drive whatever breakthroughs you might get from it. Then, you hear about the Hyperloop. I
don’t think he has any intention of doing it. You have to wonder if it’s not meant just to be publicity
for his companies. As for Tesla, it might work. But you’re still just pushing the problems back
somewhere else. You still have to generate power. It could be that he is challenging convention less
than people think.”
These sentiments are not far off from those of Vaclav Smil, a professor emeritus at the Universityof Manitoba. Bill Gates has hailed Smil as an important writer for his tomes on energy, the
environment, and manufacturing. One of Smil’s latest works is Made in the USA, an exploration of
America’s past manufacturing glories and its subsequent, dismal loss of industry. Anyone who thinks
the United States is making a natural, clever shift away from manufacturing and toward higher-paying
information-worker jobs will want to read this book and have a gander at the long-term consequences
of this change. Smil presents numerous examples of the ways in which the manufacturing industry
generates major innovations and creates a massive ecosystem of jobs and technical smarts around
them. “For example, when some three decades ago the United States stopped making virtually all
‘commodity’ consumer electronic devices and displays, it also lost its capacity to develop and massproduce advanced flat screens and batteries, two classes of products that are quintessential for
portable computers and cell phones and whose large-scale imports keep adding to the US trade
deficit,” Smil wrote. A bit later in the book, Smil emphasized that the aerospace industry, in
particular, has been a huge boon to the U.S. economy and one of its major exporters. “Maintaining the
sector’s competitiveness must be a key component of efforts to boost US exports, and the exports will
have to be a large part of the sector’s sales because the world’s largest aerospace market of the next
two decades will be in Asia, above all in China and India, and American aircraft and aeroengine
makers should benefit from this expansion.”
Smil is consumed by the United States’ waning ability to compete with China and yet does not
perceive Musk or his companies as any sort of counter to this slide. “As, among other things, a
historian of technical advances I simply must see Tesla as nothing but an utterly derivative overhyped
toy for showoffs,” Smil wrote to me. “The last thing a country with 50 million people on food stamps
and 85 billion dollars deeper into debt every month needs is anything to do with space, especially
space with more joyrides for the super rich. And the loop proposal was nothing but bamboozling
people who do not know anything about kindergarten physics with a very old, long publicized
Gedankenexperiment in kinetics. . . . There are many inventive Americans, but in that lineup Musk
would be trailing far behind.”
The comments were blunt and surprising given some of the things Smil celebrated in his recent
book. He spent a good deal of time showing the positive impact that Henry Ford’s vertical integration
had on advancing the car industry and the American economy. He also wrote at length about the rise
of “mechatronic machines,” or machines that rely on a lot of electronics and software. “By 2010 the
electronic controls for a typical sedan required more lines of software code than the instructions
needed to operate the latest Boeing jetliner,” Smil wrote. “American manufacturing has turned
modern cars into remarkable mechatronic machines. The first decade of the twenty-first century also
brought innovations ranging from the deployment of new materials (carbon composites in aviation,
nanostructures) to wireless electronics.”
There’s a tendency among critics to dismiss Musk as a frivolous dreamer that stems first and
foremost from a misunderstanding of what Musk is actually doing. People like Smil seem to catch an
article or television show that hits on Musk’s quest to get to Mars and immediately lump him with the
space tourism crowd. Musk, though, hardly ever talks about tourism and has, since day one, built up
SpaceX to compete at the industrial end of the space business. If Smil thinks Boeing selling planes is
crucial to the American economy, then he should be enthused about what SpaceX has managed to
accomplish in the commercial launch market. SpaceX builds its products in the United States, has
made dramatic advances in aerospace technology, and has made similar advances in materials andmanufacturing techniques. It would not take much to argue that SpaceX is America’s only hope of
competing against China in the next couple of decades. As for mechatronic machines, SpaceX and
Tesla have set the example of fusing together electronics, software, and metal that their rivals are now
struggling to match. And all of Musk’s companies, including SolarCity, have made dramatic use of
vertical integration and turned in-house control of components into a real advantage.
To get a sense of how powerful Musk’s work may end up being for the American economy, have a
think about the dominant mechatronic machine of the past several years: the smartphone. Pre-iPhone,
the United States was the laggard in the telecommunications industry. All of the exciting cell phones
and mobile services were in Europe and Asia, while American consumers bumbled along with dated
equipment. When the iPhone arrived in 2007, it changed everything. Apple’s device mimicked many
of the functions of a computer and then added new abilities with its apps, sensors, and location
awareness. Google charged to market with its Android software and related handsets, and the United
States suddenly emerged as the driving force in the mobile industry. Smartphones were revolutionary
because of the ways they allowed hardware, software, and services to work in unison. This was a
mix that favored the skills of Silicon Valley. The rise of the smartphone led to a massive industrial
boom in which Apple became the most valuable company in the country, and billions of its clever
devices were spread all over the world.
Tony Fadell, the former Apple executive credited with bringing the iPod and iPhone to market,
has characterized the smartphone as representative of a type of super-cycle in which hardware and
software have reached a critical point of maturity. Electronics are good and cheap, while software is
more reliable and sophisticated. Their interplay is now resulting in science fiction–worthy ideas we
were promised long ago becoming a reality. Google has its self-driving cars and has acquired dozens
of robotics companies as it looks to merge code and machine. Fadell’s company Nest has its
intelligent thermostats and smoke alarms. General Electric has jet engines packed full of sensors
taught to proactively report possible anomalies to its human mechanics. And a host of start-ups have
begun infusing medical devices with powerful software to help people monitor and analyze their
bodies and diagnose conditions. Tiny satellites are being put into orbit twenty at a time, and instead of
being given a fixed task for their entire lifetimes, like their predecessors, they’re being reprogrammed
on the fly for a wide variety of business and scientific tasks. Zee Aero, a start-up in Mountain View,
has a couple of former SpaceX staffers on hand and is working on a secretive new type of transport.
A flying car at last? Perhaps.
For Fadell, Musk’s work sits at the highest end of this trend. “He could have just made an electric
car,” Fadell said. “But he did things like use motors to actuate the door handles. He’s bringing the
consumer electronics and the software together, and the other car companies are trying to figure out a
way to get there. Whether it’s Tesla or SpaceX taking Ethernet cables and running them inside of
rocket ships, you are talking about combining the old-world science of manufacturing with low-cost,
consumer-grade technology. You put these things together, and they morph into something we have
never seen before. All of a sudden there is a wholesale change,” he said. “It’s a step function.”
To the extent that Silicon Valley has searched for an inheritor to Steve Jobs’s role as the dominant,
guiding force of the technology industry, Musk has emerged as the most likely candidate. He’s
certainly the “it” guy of the moment. Start-up founders, proven executives, and legends hold him up as
the person they most admire. The more mainstream Tesla can become, the more Musk’s reputation
will rise. A hot-selling Model 3 would certify Musk as that rare being able to rethink an industry,read consumers, and execute. From there, his more fanciful ideas start to seem inevitable. “Elon is
one of the few people that I feel is more accomplished than I am,” said Craig Venter, the man who
decoded the human genome and went on to create synthetic lifeforms. At some point he hopes to work
with Musk on a type of DNA printer that could be sent to Mars. It would, in theory, allow humans to
create medicines, food, and helpful microbes for early settlers of the planet. “I think biological
teleportation is what is going to truly enable the colonization of space,” he said. “Elon and I have
been talking about how this might play out.”
One of Musk’s most ardent admirers is also one of his best friends: Larry Page, the cofounder and
CEO of Google. Page has ended up on Musk’s house-surfing schedule. “He’s kind of homeless, which
I think is sort of funny,” Page said. “He’ll e-mail and say, ‘I don’t know where to stay tonight. Can I
come over?’ I haven’t given him a key or anything yet.”
Google has invested more than just about any other technology company into Musk’s sort of moonshot projects: self-driving cars, robots, and even a cash prize to get a machine onto the moon cheaply.
The company, however, operates under a set of constraints and expectations that come with employing
tens of thousands of people and being analyzed constantly by investors. It’s with this in mind that Page
sometimes feels a bit envious of Musk, who has managed to make radical ideas the basis of his
companies. “If you think about Silicon Valley or corporate leaders in general, they’re not usually
lacking in money,” Page said. “If you have all this money, which presumably you’re going to give
away and couldn’t even spend it all if you wanted to, why then are you devoting your time to a
company that’s not really doing anything good? That’s why I find Elon to be an inspiring example. He
said, ‘Well, what should I really do in this world? Solve cars, global warming, and make humans
multiplanetary.’ I mean those are pretty compelling goals, and now he has businesses to do that.”
“This becomes a competitive advantage for him, too. Why would you want to work for a defense
contractor when you can work for a guy who wants to go to Mars and he’s going to move heaven and
earth to make it happen? You can frame a problem in a way that’s really good for the business.”
At one point, a quotation from Page made the rounds, saying that he wanted to leave all of his
money to Musk. Page felt he was misquoted but stood by the sentiment. “I’m not leaving my money to
him at the moment,” Page said. “But Elon makes a pretty compelling case for having a multiplanetary
society just because, you know, otherwise we might all die, which seems like it would be sad for all
sorts of different reasons. I think it’s a very doable project, and it’s a relatively modest resource that
we need to set up a permanent human settlement on Mars. I was just trying to make the point that that’s
a really powerful idea.”
As Page puts it, “Good ideas are always crazy until they’re not.” It’s a principle he’s tried to
apply at Google. When Page and Sergey Brin began wondering aloud about developing ways to
search the text inside of books, all of the experts they consulted said it would be impossible to
digitize every book. The Google cofounders decided to run the numbers and see if it was actually
physically possible to scan the books in a reasonable amount of time. They concluded it was, and
Google has since scanned millions of books. “I’ve learned that your intuition about things you don’t
know that much about isn’t very good,” Page said. “The way Elon talks about this is that you always
need to start with the first principles of a problem. What are the physics of it? How much time will it
take? How much will it cost? How much cheaper can I make it? There’s this level of engineering and
physics that you need to make judgments about what’s possible and interesting. Elon is unusual in that
he knows that, and he also knows business and organization and leadership and governmental issues.”Some of the conversations between Musk and Page take place at a secret apartment Google owns
in downtown Palo Alto. It’s inside of one of the taller buildings in the area and offers views of the
mountains surrounding the Stanford University campus. Page and Brin will take private meetings at
the apartment and have their own chef on call to prepare food for guests. When Musk is present, the
chats tend toward the absurd and fantastic. “I was there once, and Elon was talking about building an
electric jet plane that can take off and land vertically,” said George Zachary, the venture capitalist and
friend of Musk’s. “Larry said the plane should be able to land on ski slopes, and Sergey said it
needed to be able to dock at a port in Manhattan. Then they started talking about building a commuter
plane that was always circling the Earth, and you’d hop up to it and get places incredibly fast. I
thought everyone was kidding, but at the end I asked Elon, ‘Are you really going to do that?’ And he
said, ‘Yes.’”
“It’s kind of our recreation, I guess,” said Page.23 “It’s fun for the three of us to talk about kind of
crazy things, and we find stuff that eventually turns out to be real. We go through hundreds or
thousands of possible things before arriving at the ones that are most promising.”
Page talked about Musk at times as if he were a one-of-a-kind, a force of nature able to
accomplish things in the business world that others would never even try. “We think of SpaceX and
Tesla as being these tremendously risky things, but I think Elon was going to make them work no
matter what. He’s willing to suffer some personal cost, and I think that makes his odds actually pretty
good. If you knew him personally, you would look back to when he started the companies and say his
odds of success would be more than ninety percent. I mean we just have a single proof point now that
you can be really passionate about something that other people think is crazy and you can really
succeed. And you look at it with Elon and you say, ‘Well, maybe it’s not luck. He’s done it twice. It
can’t be luck totally.’ I think that means it should be repeatable in some sense. At least it’s repeatable
by him. Maybe we should get him to do more things.”
Page holds Musk up as a model he wishes others would emulate—a figure that should be
replicated during a time in which the businessmen and politicians have fixated on short-term,
inconsequential goals. “I don’t think we’re doing a good job as a society deciding what things are
really important to do,” Page said. “I think like we’re just not educating people in this kind of general
way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some
leadership training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and
raise money. I don’t think most people are doing that, and it’s a big problem. Engineers are usually
trained in a very fixed area. When you’re able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind
of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. I think that’s really
an important thing for the world. That’s how we make progress.”
The pressure of feeling the need to fix the world takes its toll on Musk’s body. There are times
when you run into Musk and he looks utterly exhausted. He does not have bags under his eyes but
rather deep, shadowy valleys. During the worst of times, following weeks of sleep deprivation, his
eyes seem to have sunk back into his skull. Musk’s weight moves up and down with the stress, and
he’s usually heavier when really overworked. It’s funny in a way that Musk spends so much time
talking about man’s survival but isn’t willing to address the consequences of what his lifestyle does to
his body. “Elon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is short,” Straubel said. “If you
really embrace this, it leaves you with the obvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as
you can.”Suffering, though, has always been Musk’s thing. The kids at school tortured him. His father
played brutal mind games. Musk then abused himself by working inhumane hours and forever pushing
his businesses to the edge. The idea of work-life balance seems meaningless in this context. For
Musk, it’s just life, and his wife and kids try to fit into the show where they can. “I’m a pretty good
dad,” Musk said. “I have the kids for slightly more than half the week and spend a fair bit of time with
them. I also take them with me when I go out of town. Recently, we went to the Monaco Grand Prix
and were hanging out with the prince and princess of Monaco. It all seemed quite normal to the kids,
and they were blasé about it. They are growing up having a set of experiences that are extremely
unusual, but you don’t realize experiences are unusual until you are much older. They’re just your
experiences. They have good manners at meals.”
It bothers Musk a bit that his kids won’t suffer like he did. He feels that the suffering helped to
make him who he is and gave him extra reserves of strength and will. “They might have a little
adversity at school, but these days schools are so protective,” he said. “If you call someone a name,
you get sent home. When I was going to school, if they punched you and there was no blood, it was
like, ‘Whatever. Shake it off.’ Even if there was a little blood, but not a lot, it was fine. What do I do?
Create artificial adversity? How do you do that? The biggest battle I have is restricting their video
game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play
video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they
downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych
101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is
like Flappy Bird, but at least there is some physics involved.”
Musk has talked about having more kids, and it’s on this subject that he delivers some
controversial philosophizing vis-à-vis the creator of Beavis and Butt-head. “There’s this point that
Mike Judge makes in Idiocracy, which is like smart people, you know, should at least sustain their
numbers,” Musk said. “Like, if it’s a negative Darwinian vector, then obviously that’s not a good
thing. It should be at least neutral. But if each successive generation of smart people has fewer kids,
that’s probably bad, too. I mean, Europe, Japan, Russia, China are all headed for demographic
implosion. And the fact of the matter is that basically the wealthier—basically wealth, education, and
being secular are all indicative of low birth rate. They all correlate with low birth rate. I’m not
saying like only smart people should have kids. I’m just saying that smart people should have kids as
well. They should at least maintain—at least be a replacement rate. And the fact of the matter is that I
notice that a lot of really smart women have zero or one kid. You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s probably not
good.’”
The next decade of Musk Co. should be quite something. Musk has given himself a chance to
become one of the greatest businessmen and innovators of all time. By 2025 Tesla could very well
have a lineup of five or six cars and be the dominant force in a booming electric car market. Playing
off its current growth rate, SolarCity will have had time to emerge as a massive utility company and
the leader in a solar market that had finally lived up to its promise. SpaceX? Well, it’s perhaps the
most intriguing. According to Musk’s calculations, SpaceX should be conducting weekly flights to
space, carrying humans and cargo, and have put most of its competitors out of business. Its rockets
should be capable of doing a couple of laps around the moon and then landing with pinpoint accuracy
back at the spaceport in Texas. And the preparation for the first few dozen trips to Mars should be
well under way.If all of this were taking place, Musk, then in his mid-fifties, likely would be the richest man in the
world and among its most powerful. He would be the majority shareholder in three public companies,
and history would be preparing to smile broadly on what he had accomplished. During a time in
which countries and other businesses were paralyzed by indecision and inaction, Musk would have
mounted the most viable charge against global warming, while also providing people with an escape
plan—just in case. He would have brought a substantial amount of crucial manufacturing back to the
United States while also providing an example for other entrepreneurs hoping to harness a new age of
wonderful machines. As Thiel said, Musk may well have gone so far as to give people hope and to
have renewed their faith in what technology can do for mankind.
This future, of course, remains precarious. Huge technological issues confront all three of Musk’s
companies. He’s bet on the inventiveness of man and the ability of solar, battery, and aerospace
technology to follow predicted price and performance curves. Even if these bets hit as he hopes,
Tesla could face a weird, unexpected recall. SpaceX could have a rocket carrying humans blow up—
an incident that could very well end the company on the spot. Dramatic risks accompany just about
everything Musk does.
By the time our last dinner had come around, I had decided that this propensity for risk had little
to do with Musk being insane, as he had wondered aloud several months earlier. No, Musk just seems
to possess a level of conviction that is so intense and exceptional as to be off-putting to some. As we
shared some chips and guacamole and cocktails, I asked Musk directly just how much he was willing
to put on the line. His response? Everything that other people hold dear. “I would like to die on
Mars,” he said. “Just not on impact. Ideally I’d like to go for a visit, come back for a while, and then
go there when I’m like seventy or something and then just stay there. If things turn out well, that would
be the case. If my wife and I have a bunch of kids, she would probably stay with them on Earth.”EPILOGUE
ELON MUSK IS A BODY THAT REMAINS VERY MUCH IN MOTION.
By the time this book reaches your hands, it’s quite possible that Musk and SpaceX will have
managed to land a rocket on a barge at sea or back on a launchpad in Florida. Tesla Motors may have
unveiled some of the special features of the Model X. Musk could have formally declared war on the
artificial intelligence machines coming to life inside of Google’s data centers. Who knows?
What’s clear is that Musk’s desire to take on more keeps growing. Just as I was putting the
finishing touches on this book, Musk unfurled a number of major initiatives. The most dramatic of
which is a plan to surround the Earth with thousands of small communications satellites. Musk wants,
in effect, to build a space-based Internet in which the satellites would be close enough to the planet to
beam down bandwidth at high speeds. Such a system would be useful for a couple of reasons: In
areas too poor or too remote to have fiber-optic connections, it would provide people with highspeed Internet for the first time. It could also function as an efficient backhaul network for businesses
and consumers.
Musk, of course, also sees this space Internet as key to his long-term ambitions around Mars. “It
will be important for Mars to have a global communications network,” he said. “I think this needs to
be done, and I don’t see anyone else doing it.” SpaceX will build these satellites at a new factory and
will also look to sell more satellites to commercial customers as it perfects the technology. To fund
part of this unbelievably ambitious project, SpaceX secured $1 billion from Google and Fidelity. In a
rare moment of restraint, Musk declined to provide an exact delivery date for his space Internet,
which he forecasts will cost more than $10 billion to build. “People should not expect this to be
active sooner than five years,” he said. “But we see it as a long-term revenue source for SpaceX to be
able to fund a city on Mars.”
Meanwhile, SolarCity has purchased a new research and development facility near the Tesla
factory in Silicon Valley that’s intended to aid its manufacturing work. The building it acquired was
the old Solyndra manufacturing plant—another symbol of Musk’s ability to thrive in the green
technology industry that has destroyed so many other entrepreneurs. And Tesla continues to build its
Gigafactory in Nevada at pace, while its network of charging stations has saved upward of four
million gallons of gas. During a quarterly earnings announcement, J. B. Straubel promised that Tesla
would start producing battery systems for home use in 2015 that would let people hop off the grid for
periods of time. Musk then one-upped Straubel, bragging that he thinks Tesla could eventually be
more valuable than Apple and could challenge it in the race to be the first $1 trillion company. A
handful of groups have also set to work building prototype Hyperloop systems in and around
California. Oh, and Musk starred in an episode of The Simpsons titled “The Musk Who Fell to
Earth,” in which Homer became his inventive muse.The heady expansion plans and triumphant rhetoric from Musk were still not quite enough to hide
all of Musk Co.’s flaws. Early 2015 marked the vociferous return of Musk’s detractors on Wall
Street. Tesla’s sales in China were lackluster by any measure, and some analysts renewed their
doubts about how much long-term demand there would be for the Model S. Tesla’s shares slumped
and, for the first time in a while, Musk sounded flustered trying to defend the company’s position.
The personal costs of Musk’s lifestyle were more severe. Musk announced that, once again, he
would be divorcing Talulah Riley. According to Musk, Riley wanted a simpler, smaller life in
England and had come to despise Los Angeles. “Tried to talk her out of it, but she insisted,” Musk
told me. “It is possible that she will change her mind at some point, but not anytime soon.”
After finishing my reporting and writing for this book, I had a chance to speak with some of
Musk’s confidantes and employees in a more relaxed manner and bounce various ideas off of them.
I’m more convinced than ever that Musk is, and has always been, a man on a quest, and that his brand
of quest is far more fantastic and consuming than anything most of us will ever experience. It seems
that he’s become almost addicted to expanding his ambitions and can’t quite stop himself from
announcing things like the Hyperloop and the space Internet. I’m also more convinced than ever that
Musk is a deeply emotional person who suffers and rejoices in an epic fashion. This side of him is
likely obscured by the fact that he feels most deeply about his own humanity-altering quest and so has
trouble recognizing the strong emotions of those around him. This tends to make Musk come off as
aloof and hard. I would argue, however, that his brand of empathy is unique. He seems to feel for the
human species as a whole without always wanting to consider the wants and needs of individuals.
And it may well be the case that this is exactly the type of person it takes to make a freaking space
Internet real.APPENDIX 1
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY LOVES MESSY FOUNDING TALES. A bit of backstabbing? A
hearty helping of deceit? Perfect. And yet, the press has never really dug into the alleged intrigue
surrounding Musk’s formation of Zip2, nor have reporters examined the very serious allegations of
inconsistencies in Musk’s academic record.
In April 2007, a physicist named John O’Reilly filed a lawsuit alleging that Musk had stolen the
idea for Zip2. According to the lawsuit, filed with the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara,
O’Reilly first met Musk in October 1995. O’Reilly had started a company called Internet Merchant
Channel, or IMC, which planned to let businesses create primitive, information-packed online ads. A
restaurant, for example, could build an ad that would display its menu and perhaps even turn-by-turn
directions to its location. O’Reilly’s ideas were mostly theoretical, but Zip2 did end up providing a
very similar service. O’Reilly alleged that Musk had first heard about this type of technology while
trying to get a job working as a salesman for IMC. He and Musk met on at least three occasions,
according to the lawsuit, to talk about the job. O’Reilly then went on an overseas trip and struggled to
get back in touch with Musk upon his return.
O’Reilly declined to discuss his case against Musk with me. But in the lawsuit, he claimed to
have learned about Zip2 through happenstance many years after meeting Musk. While reading a book
in 2005 about the Internet economy, O’Reilly stumbled upon a passage that mentioned Musk’s
founding of Zip2 and its 1999 sale to Compaq Computer for $307 million in cash. The physicist was
blown away as he realized that Zip2 sounded a lot like IMC, which had never amounted to much of a
business. O’Reilly’s mind raced back to his encounters with Musk. He began to suspect that Musk had
avoided him on purpose and that instead of becoming an IMC salesman, Musk had run off to pursue
the same concept on his own. O’Reilly wanted to be compensated for coming up with the original
business idea. He spent about two years making his case against Musk. The case file at the court runs
hundreds of pages. O’Reilly has affidavits from people that back up parts of his version of events. A
judge, however, found that O’Reilly lacked the necessary legal standing to bring this case against
Musk due to issues around how his businesses had been dissolved. The judge ordered O’Reilly to
shell out $125,000 for Musk’s legal fees in 2010. All these years later, Musk still hasn’t made
O’Reilly pay.
While playing detective, O’Reilly unearthed some information about Musk’s past that’s arguably
more interesting than the allegations in the lawsuit. He found that the University of Pennsylvania
granted Musk’s degrees in 1997—two years later than what Musk has cited. I called Penn’s registrar
and verified these findings. Copies of Musk’s records show that he received a dual degree in
economics and physics in May 1997. O’Reilly also subpoenaed the registrar’s office at Stanford to
verify Musk’s admittance in 1995 for his doctorate work in physics. “Based on the information youprovided, we are unable to locate a record in our office for Elon Musk,” wrote the director of
graduate admissions. When asked during the case to produce a document verifying Musk’s enrollment
at Stanford, Musk’s attorney declined and called the request “unduly burdensome.” I contacted a
number of Stanford physics professors who taught in 1995, and they either failed to respond or didn’t
remember Musk. Doug Osheroff, a Nobel Prize winner and department chair at the time, said, “I don’t
think I knew Elon, and am pretty sure that he was not in the Physics Department.”
In the years that have followed, Musk’s enemies have been quick to bring up the ambiguities
around his admission to Stanford. When Martin Eberhard sued Musk, his attorney introduced
O’Reilly’s research into the case. And during the course of my interviews, a number of Musk’s
detractors from the Zip2, PayPal, and early Tesla days said flat out that they think Musk fibbed about
getting into Stanford in a bid to boost his credentials as a fledgling entrepreneur and then had to stick
with the story after Zip2 took off.
At first, I, too, felt like there were a lot of oddities surrounding Musk’s academic record,
particularly the Stanford days. But, as I dug in, there were solid explanations for all of the
inconsistencies and plenty of evidence to undermine the cases of Musk’s detractors.
During the course of my reporting, for example, I found evidence that contradicted O’Reilly’s
timeline of events. Peter Nicholson, the banker whom Musk had worked for in Canada, took a stroll
with Musk along the boardwalk in Toronto before Musk left for Stanford and chatted about the
incarnations of something like Zip2. Musk had already started writing some of the early software to
support the idea he’d outlined to Kimbal. “He was agonizing whether to do a PhD at Stanford or take
this piece of software he’d made in his spare time and make a business out of it,” Nicholson said.
“He called the thing the Virtual City Navigator. I told him there was this crazy Internet thing going on,
and that people will pay big money for damn near anything. This software was a golden opportunity.
He could do a PhD anytime.” Kimbal and other members of Musk’s family have similar memories.
Musk, speaking at length for the first time on the subject, denied everything alleged by O’Reilly
and does not even recall meeting the man. “He’s a total scumbag,” Musk said. “O’Reilly is like a
failed physicist who became a serial litigate. And I told the guy, ‘Look, I’m not going to settle an
unjust case. So it’s just like don’t even try.’ But he still kept at it. His case was tossed out twice on
demur, which means that basically even if all the facts in his case were true, he would still lose.
“He’d tried his best to like torture me through my friends and personally [by filing the lawsuit].
And then we’ve got summary judgment. He lost the summary judgment. He appealed summary
judgment, then several months later lost the appeal and I was like, ‘Okay, fuck it. Let’s file for fees.’
And we were awarded fees from when he appealed. And that’s when we sent the sheriff after him and
he claimed that he had no money basically. Whether he did or didn’t I don’t know. He certainly
claimed he had no money. So we were like either we’ve got to like impound his car or tap his wife’s
income. Those didn’t seem like great choices. So, we decided that he doesn’t have to pay back the
money he owes me, so long as he doesn’t sue anyone else on frivolous grounds. And, in fact, late last
year or early this year [2014], he tried to do just that thing. But, whoever he sued was aware of the
nature of my judgment and contacted the lawyer I used, who then told O’Reilly, ‘Look, you need to
drop the case against these guys or everyone’s going to ask for the money. It’s kind of pointless to sue
them on frivolous grounds because you’re going to have fork over the winnings to Elon.’ It’s like go
do something productive with your life.”
As for his academic records, Musk produced a document for me dated June 22, 2009, that camefrom Judith Haccou, the director of graduate admissions in the office of the registrar at Stanford
University. It read, “As per special request from my colleagues in the School of Engineering, I have
searched Stanford’s admission data base and acknowledge that you applied and were admitted to the
graduate program in Material Science Engineering in 1995. Since you did not enroll, Stanford is not
able to issue you an official certification document.”
Musk also had an explanation for the weird timing on his degrees from Penn. “I had a History and
an English credit that I agreed with Penn that I would do at Stanford,” he said. “Then I put Stanford on
deferment. Later, Penn’s requirements changed so that you don’t need the English and History credit.
So then they awarded me the degree in ’97 when it was clear I was not going to go to grad school,
and their requirement was no longer there.
“I finished everything that was needed for a Wharton degree in ’94. They’d actually mailed me a
Wharton degree. I decided to spend another year and finished the physics degree, but then there was
that History and English credit thing. I was only reminded about the History and English thing when I
tried to get an H-1B visa and called the school to get a copy of my graduation certificate, and they
said I hadn’t graduated. Then they looked into the new requirements, and said it was fine.”APPENDIX 2
WHILE MUSK HAS REFLECTED PUBLICLY ABOUT HIS TIME AT PAYPAL AND THE COUP,
he went into far greater detail than ever before during one of our longer interviews. Years had passed
since the tumultuous days surrounding his ouster, and Musk had been able to meditate more on what
went right, what went wrong, and what might have been. He started by discussing his decision to go
out of the country, mixing business with a delayed honeymoon, and ended with an explanation of how
the finance industry still hasn’t solved the problems X.com wanted to tackle.
“The problem with me going away was that I was not there to reassure the board on a few things.
Like, the brand change, I think it would have been the right move, but it didn’t need to happen right
then. At the time it was this weird almost hybrid brand with X.com and PayPal. I think X was the right
long-term brand for something that wants to be the central place where all transactions happen. That’s
the X. It’s like the X is the transaction. PayPal doesn’t make sense in that context, when we’re talking
about something more than a personal payment system. I think X was the more sensible approach but
timing-wise it didn’t need to happen then. That should have probably waited longer.
“As for the technology change, that’s not really well understood. On the face of it, it doesn’t sound
like it makes much sense for us to be writing our front-end code in Microsoft C++ instead of Linux.
But the reason is that the programming tools for Microsoft and a PC are actually extremely powerful.
They’re developed for the gaming industry. I mean, this is going to sound like heresy in a sort of
Silicon Valley context, but you can program faster, you can get functionality faster in the PC C++
world. All of the games for the Xbox are written in Microsoft C++. The same goes for games on the
PC. They’re incredibly sophisticated, hard things to do, and these great tools have been developed
thanks to the gaming industry. There were more smart programmers in the gaming industry than
anywhere else. I’m not sure the general public understands this. It was also 2000, and there were not
the huge software libraries for Linux that you would find today. Microsoft had huge support libraries.
So you could get a DLL that could do anything, but you couldn’t get—you couldn’t get Linux libraries
that could do anything.
“Two of the guys that left PayPal went off to Blizzard and helped created World of Warcraft.
When you look at the complexity of something like that living on PCs and Microsoft C++, it’s pretty
incredible. It blows away any website.
“In retrospect, I should have delayed the brand transition, and I should have spent a lot more time
with Max getting him comfortable on the technology. I mean, it was a little difficult because like the
Linux system Max had created was called Max Code. So Max has had quite a strong affinity for Max
Code. This was a bunch of libraries that Max and his friends had done. But it just made it quite hard
to develop new features. And if you look at PayPal today, I mean, part of the reason they haven’t
developed any new features is because it’s quite difficult to maintain the old system.“Ultimately, I didn’t disagree with the board’s decision in the PayPal case, in the sense that with
the information that the board had I would have made maybe the same decision. I probably would
have, whereas in the case of Zip2 I would not have. I thought they just simply made a terrible decision
based on information they had. I don’t think the X.com board made a terrible decision based on the
information they had. But it did make me want to be careful about who invested in my companies in
the future.
“I’ve thought about trying to get PayPal back. I’ve just been too strung out with other things.
Almost no one understands how PayPal actually worked or why it took off when other payment
systems before and after it didn’t. Most of the people at PayPal don’t understand this. The reason it
worked was because the cost of transactions in PayPal was lower than any other system. And the
reason the cost of transactions was lower is because we were able to do an increasing percentage of
our transactions as ACH, or automated clearinghouse, electronic transactions, and most importantly,
internal transactions. Internal transactions were essentially fraud-free and cost us nothing. An ACH
transaction costs, I don’t know, like twenty cents or something. But it was slow, so that was the bad
thing. It’s dependent on the bank’s batch processing time. And then the credit card transaction was
fast, but expensive in terms of the credit card processing fees and very prone to fraud. That’s the
problem Square is having now.
“Square is doing the wrong version of PayPal. The critical thing is to achieve internal
transactions. This is vital because they are instant, fraud-free, and fee-free. If you’re a seller and have
various options, and PayPal has the lowest fees and is the most secure, it’s obviously the right thing to
use.
“When you look at like any given business, like say a business is making 10 percent profitability.
They’re making 10 percent profit when they may net out all of their costs. You know, revenue minus
expenses in a year, they’re 10 percent. If using PayPal means you pay 2 percent for your transactions
and using some other systems means you pay 4 percent, that means using PayPal gives you a 20
percent increase in your profitability. You’d have to be brain dead not to do that. Right?
“So because about half of PayPal’s transactions in the summer of 2001 were internal or ACH
transactions, then our fundamental costs of transactions were half because we’d have half credit
cards, we’d have that and then the other half would be free. The question then is how do you give
people a reason to keep money in the system.
“That’s why we created a PayPal debit card. It’s a little counterintuitive, but the easier you make
it for people to get money out of PayPal, the less they’ll want to do it. But if the only way for them to
spend money or access it in any way is to move it to a traditional bank, that’s what they’ll do
instantly. The other thing was the PayPal money market fund. We did that because if you consider the
reasons that people might move the money out, well, they’ll move it to either conduct transactions in
the physical world or because they’re getting a higher interest rate. So I instituted the highest-return
money market fund in the country. Basically, the money market fund was at cost. We didn’t intend to
make any money on it, in order to encourage people to keep their money in the system. And then we
also had like the ability to pay regular bills like your electricity bill and that kind of thing on PayPal.
“There were a bunch of things that should have been done like checks. Because even though
people don’t use a lot of checks they still use some checks. So if you force people to say, ‘Okay,
we’re not going to let you use checks ever,’ they’re like, ‘Okay, I guess I have to have a bank account.’
Just give them a few checks, for God’s sake.“I mean, it’s so ridiculous that PayPal today is worse than PayPal circa end of 2001. That’s
insane.
“None of these start-ups understand the objective. The objective should be—what delivers
fundamental value. I think it’s important to look at things from a standpoint of what is actually the best
thing for the economy. If people can conduct their transactions quickly and securely that’s better for
them. If it’s simpler to conduct their financial life it’s better for them. So, if all your financial affairs
are seamlessly integrated one place it’s very easy to do transactions and the fees associated with
transactions are low. These are all good things. Why aren’t they doing this? It’s mad.”APPENDIX 3

Subject: Going Public
Per my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about SpaceX going public before
the Mars transport system is in place. Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars
is and always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public company diminishes
that likelihood, then we should not do so until Mars is secure. This is something that I am open
to reconsidering, but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to foist
being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature of our mission.
Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that
being public is desirable. This is not so. Public company stocks, particularly if big step
changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal
execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy. This
causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating
great products.
It is important to emphasize that Tesla and SolarCity are public because they didn’t have
any choice. Their private capital structure was becoming unwieldy and they needed to raise a
lot of equity capital. SolarCity also needed to raise a huge amount of debt at the lowest
possible interest rate to fund solar leases. The banks who provide that debt wanted SolarCity
to have the additional and painful scrutiny that comes with being public. Those rules, referred
to as Sarbanes-Oxley, essentially result in a tax being levied on company execution by
requiring detailed reporting right down to how your meal is expensed during travel and you
can be penalized even for minor mistakes.
YES, BUT I COULD MAKE MORE MONEY IF WE WERE
PUBLIC
For those who are under the impression that they are so clever that they can outsmart public
market investors and would sell SpaceX stock at the “right time,” let me relieve you of any
such notion. If you really are better than most hedge fund managers, then there is no need to
worry about the value of your SpaceX stock, as you can just invest in other public companystocks and make billions of dollars in the market.
If you think: “Ah, but I know what’s really going on at SpaceX and that will give me an
edge,” you are also wrong. Selling public company stock with insider knowledge is illegal.
As a result, selling public stock is restricted to narrow time windows a few times per year.
Even then, you can be prosecuted for insider trading. At Tesla, we had both an employee and
an investor go through a grand jury investigation for selling stock over a year ago, despite
them doing everything right in both the letter and spirit of the law. Not fun.
Another thing that happens to public companies is that you become a target of the trial
lawyers who create a class action lawsuit by getting someone to buy a few hundred shares and
then pretending to sue the company on behalf of all investors for any drop in the stock price.
Tesla is going through that right now even though the stock price is relatively high, because the
drop in question occurred last year.
It is also not correct to think that because Tesla and SolarCity share prices are on the lofty
side right now, that SpaceX would be too. Public companies are judged on quarterly
performance. Just because some companies are doing well, doesn’t mean that all would. Both
of those companies (Tesla in particular) had great first quarter results. SpaceX did not. In fact,
financially speaking, we had an awful first quarter. If we were public, the short sellers would
be hitting us over the head with a large stick.
We would also get beaten up every time there was an anomaly on the rocket or spacecraft,
as occurred on flight 4 with the engine failure and flight 5 with the Dragon prevalves.
Delaying launch of V1.1, which is now over a year behind schedule, would result in
particularly severe punishment, as that is our primary revenue driver. Even something as
minor as pushing a launch back a few weeks from one quarter to the next gets you a spanking.
Tesla vehicle production in Q4 last year was literally only three weeks behind and yet the
market response was brutal.
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
My goal at SpaceX is to give you the best aspects of a public and private company. When we
do a financing round, the stock price is keyed off of approximately what we would be worth if
publicly traded, excluding irrational exuberance or depression, but without the pressure and
distraction of being under a hot public spotlight. Rather than have the stock be up during one
liquidity window and down during another, the goal is a steady upward trend and never to let
the share price go below the last round. The end result for you (or an investor in SpaceX)
financially will be the same as if we were public and you sold a steady amount of stock every
year.
In case you are wondering about a specific number, I can say that I’m confident that our
long term stock price will be over $100 if we execute well on Falcon 9 and Dragon. For this
to be the case, we must have a steady and rapid cadence of launch that is far better than what
we have achieved in the past. We have more work ahead of us than you probably realize. Let
me give you a sense of where things stand financially: SpaceX expenses this year will be
roug[h]ly $800 to $900 million (which blows my mind btw). Since we get revenue of $60Mfor every F9 flight or double that for a FH or F9-Dragon flight, we must have about twelve
flights per year where four of those flights are either Dragon or Heavy merely in order to
achieve 10% profitability!
For the next few years, we have NASA commercial crew funding that helps supplement
those numbers, but, after that, we are on our own. That is not much time to finish F9, FH,
Dragon V2 and achieve an average launch rate of at least one per month. And bear in mind
that is an average, so if we take an extra three weeks to launch a rocket for any reason (could
even be due to the satellite), we have only one week to do the follow-on flight.
MY RECOMMENDATION
Below is my advice about regarding selling SpaceX stock or options. No complicated
analysis is required, as the rules of thumb are pretty simple.
If you believe that SpaceX will execute better than the average public company, then our
stock price will continue to appreciate at a rate greater than that of the stock market, which
would be the next highest return place to invest money over the long term. Therefore, you
should sell only the amount that you need to improve your standard of living in the short to
medium term. I do actually recommend selling some amount of stock, even if you are certain it
will appreciate, as life is short and a bit more cash can increase fun and reduce stress at home
(so long as you don’t ratchet up your ongoing personal expenditures proportionately).
To maximize your post tax return, you are probably best off exercising your options to
convert them to stock (if you can afford to do this) and then holding the stock for a year before
selling it at our roughly biannual liquidity events. This allows you to pay the capital gains tax
rate, instead of the income tax rate.
On a final note, we are planning to do a liquidity event as soon as Falcon 9 qualification
is complete in one to two months. I don’t know exactly what the share price will be yet, but,
based on initial conversations with investors, I would estimate probably between $30 and
$35. This places the value of SpaceX at $4 to $5 billion, which is about what it would be if
we were public right now and, frankly, an excellent number considering that the new F9, FH
and Dragon V2 have yet to launch.
ElonACKNOWLEDGMENTS
FROM A PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, this will always be two books instead of one in my mind.
There’s the time Before Elon, and the time After Elon.
The first eighteen months or so of reporting were filled with tension, sorrow, and joy. As
mentioned in the main text, Musk initially opted against helping me with the project. This left me
going from interview subject to interview subject, giving a huge windup each time to try to talk an exTesla employee or an old schoolmate into an interview. The highs came when people agreed to talk.
The lows came when key people said no and to not bother them again. String four or five of those no’s
together in a row, and it felt at times like writing a proper book about Musk was impossible.
The thing that keeps you going is that a few people do say yes and then a few more, and—
interview by interview—you start to figure out how the past fits together. I’ll be forever grateful to
the hundreds of people who were willing to give freely of their time and especially to those who let
me come back again and again with questions. There are too many of these people to list, but gracious
souls—like Jeremy Hollman, Kevin Brogan, Dave Lyons, Ali Javidan, Michael Colonno, and Dolly
Singh—each provided invaluable insights and abundant technical help. Heartfelt thanks go as well to
Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, both of whom added crucial, rich parts to the Tesla story.
Even in this Before Elon period, Musk did permit some of his closer friends to speak with me,
and they were generous with their time and intellect. That’s a special thanks then to George Zachary
and Shervin Pishevar, and especially to Bill Lee, Antonio Gracias, and Steve Jurvetson, who really
went out of their way for Musk and for me. And I obviously owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to
Justine Musk, Maye Musk, Kimbal Musk, Peter Rive, Lyndon Rive, Russ Rive, and Scott Haldeman
for their time and for letting me hear some of the family stories. Talulah Riley was kind enough to let
me interview her and keep prying into her husband’s life. She really brought out some aspects of
Musk’s personality that I had not encountered elsewhere, and she helped build a much deeper
understanding of him. This meant a lot to me, and, I think, it will to the readers as well.
Once Musk agreed to work with me, much of the tension that accompanied the reporting went
away and was replaced by excitement. I got access to people like JB Straubel, Franz von Holzhausen,
Diarmuid O’Connell, Tom Mueller, and Gwynne Shotwell, who are all among the most intelligent and
compelling figures I’ve run into during years of reporting. I’m forever grateful for their patience
explaining bits of company history and technological basics to me and for their candor. Thanks as
well to Emily Shanklin, Hannah Post, Alexis Georgeson, Liz Jarvis-Shean, and John Taylor, for
dealing with my constant requests and pestering, and for setting up so many interviews at Musk’s
companies. Mary Beth Brown, Christina Ra, and Shanna Hendriks were no longer part of Musk Land
near the end of my reporting but were all amazing in helping me learn about Musk, Tesla, and
SpaceX.My biggest debt of gratitude, of course, goes to Musk. When we first started doing the interviews,
I would spend the hours leading up to our chats full of nerves. I never knew how long Musk would
keep participating in the project. He might have given me one interview or ten. There was real
pressure to get my most crucial questions answered up front and to be to the point in my initial
interviewing. As Musk stuck around, though, the conversations went longer, were more fluid, and
became more enlightening. They were the things I most looked forward to every month. Whether
Musk will change the course of human history in a massive way remains to be seen, but it was
certainly a thrilling privilege to get to pick the brain of someone who is reaching so high. While
reticent at first, once Musk committed to the project, he committed fully, and I’m thankful and honored
that things turned out that way.
On a professional front, I’d like to thank my editors and coworkers over the years—China
Martens, James Niccolai, John Lettice, Vindu Goel, and Suzanne Spector—each of whom taught me
different lessons about the craft of writing. Special thanks go to Andrew Orlowski, Tim O’Brien,
Damon Darlin, Jim Aley, and Drew Cullen, who have had the most impact on how I think about
writing and reporting and are among the best mentors anyone could hope for. I must also offer up
infinite thanks to Brad Wieners and Josh Tyrangiel, my bosses at Bloomberg Businessweek, for giving
me the freedom to pursue this project. I doubt there are two people doing more to support quality
journalism.
A special brand of thanks goes to Brad Stone, my colleague at the New York Times and then at
Businessweek. Brad helped me shape the idea for this book, coaxed me through dark times, and was
an unrivaled sounding board. I feel bad for pestering Brad so incessantly with my questions and
doubts. Brad is a model colleague, always there to help anyone with advice or to step up and take on
work. He’s an amazing writer and an incredible friend.
Thanks as well to Keith Lee and Sheila Abichandani Sandfort. They are two of the brightest,
kindest, most genuine people I know, and their feedback on the early text was invaluable.
My agent David Patterson and editor Hilary Redmon were instrumental in helping pull this
project off. David always seemed to say the right thing at low moments to pick up my spirits. Frankly,
I doubt the book would have happened without the encouragement and momentum he provided during
the initial part of the project. Once things got going, Hilary talked me through the trickiest moments
and elevated the book to an unexpected place. She tolerated my hissy fits and made dramatic
improvements to the writing. It’s wonderful to finish something like this and come out the other side
with a pair of such good friends. Thanks so much to you both.
Last, I have to thank my family. This book turned into a living, breathing creature that made life
difficult on my family for more than two years. I didn’t get to see my young boys as much as I would
have liked during this time, but when I did they were there with energizing smiles and hugs. I’m
thankful that they both seem to have picked up an interest in rockets and cars as a result of this
project. As for my wife, Melinda, well, she was a saint. From a practical perspective, this book
could not have happened without her support. Melinda was my best reader and ultimate confidante.
She was that best friend who knew when to try to energize me and when to let things go. Even though
this book disrupted our lives for a long while, it brought us closer together in the end. I’m blessed to
have such a partner, and I will forever remember what Melinda did for our family.NOTES

8. A southern gentleman, Currie could never get used to Musk’s swearing—“he curses like a sailor and does it in mixed company”—
or the way he would churn through prized talent. “He’d search through the woods, turn over every rock and dig through brambles to
find the one person with the specific expertise and skill he wanted,” Currie said. “Then, that guy would be gone three months to a
year later if he didn’t agree with Elon.” Currie, though, remembers Musk as inspirational. Even as Tesla’s funds dwindled, Musk
urged the employees to do their jobs well and vowed to give them what they needed to be successful. Currie, like many people, also
found Musk’s work ethic astonishing. “I would be in Europe or China and send him an email at two thirty in the morning his time,”
Currie said. “Five minutes later, I’d get an answer back. It’s just unbelievable to have support on that level.”

12. Another moment like this occurred in late 2010 during a launch attempt in Florida. One of the SpaceX technicians had left a hatch
open overnight at the launchpad, which allowed rain to flood a lower-level computing room. The water caused major issues with
SpaceX’s computing equipment, and another technician had to fly out from California right away with Musk’s American Express
card in hand to fix the emergency in the days leading up to the launch.
The SpaceX engineers bought new computing gear right away and set it up in the room. They needed to run the equipment
through standard tests to make sure it could maintain a certain voltage level. It was late at night on a Sunday, and they couldn’t get
access on short notice to a device that could simulate the high electrical load. One of the engineers improvised by going to a
hardware store where he bought twenty-five headlamps for golf carts. The SpaceX crew strung them all together back at the
la
unchpad and hung them from a wall. They then put on their sunglasses and lit everything up, knowing that if a power supply for
the computing equipment could survive this test, it would be okay for the flight. The process was repeated for numerous power
supplies, and the team worked from 9 P.M. that night until 7 A.M. and finished in time to keep the launch on track.
13. http://www.space.com/15874-private-dragon-capsule-space-station-arrival.xhtml.
14. At the conclusion of the debate, Musk and I exchanged a couple of emails. He wrote, “Oil and gas is firmly in the Romney camp
and they are feeding his campaign these talking points. Until recently, they didn’t care about Tesla, as they thought we would fail.
“Ironically, it is because they are starting to think Tesla might not fail that they are attacking us. The reason is that society has to
function, so the less there seems to be a viable alternative to burning hydrocarbons, the less pressure there is to curb carbon
emissions. If an electric car succeeds, it spoils that argument.
“Overall though, I think it is great that he mentioned us :) ‘Romney Tesla’ is one of the top Google searches!”
I reached out to Romney’s camp months later, as sales of Tesla’s soared, to see if he wanted to change his position but was
rebuffed.
15. As Tesla has grown in size, the company has commanded more respect from suppliers and been able to get better parts and better
deals. But outsourcing components still bothers Musk, and for understandable reasons. When it tried to ramp up production in 2013,
Tesla ran into periodic issues because of its suppliers. One of them made what should have been an inconsequential 12-volt lead
acid battery that handled a few auxiliary functions in the car. Tesla bought the part from an American supplier, which in turn
outsourced the part from a company in China, which in turn outsourced the part from a company in Vietnam. By the time the
battery arrived at Tesla’s factories, it didn’t work, adding cost and delays during a crucial period in the Model S’s history. It’s
situations like these that typically result in Tesla playing a much more active role with its suppliers when compared to other
automakers. For something like an ABS braking controller, Tesla will work hand-in-hand with its supplier—in this case Bosch—to
tune the hardware and software for the Model S’s specific characteristics. “Most companies just hand their cars over to Bosch, butTesla goes in with a software engineer,” said Ali Javidan. “We had to change their mind-set and let them know we wanted to work
on a very deep level.”
16. Tesla does seem to promote an obsession with safety that’s unmatched in the industry. J. B. Straubel explained the company’s
thinking as follows: “With the safety stuff, it seems like car companies have evolved to a place where their design objectives are set
by whatever is regulated or has been standardized. The rule says, ‘Do this and nothing more.’ That is amazingly boring engineering.
It leaves you maybe fiddling with the car’s shape or trying to make it a bit faster. We have more crumple zones, better deceleration,
a lower center of gravity. We went in wondering, ‘Can we make this car twice as safe as anything else on the road?’”
17. Othmer has lined up to be the lucky owner of the first Roadster II.
Musk has developed an unconventional policy to determine the order in which cars are sold. When a new car is announced and
its price is set, a race begins in which the first person to hand Musk a check gets the first car. With the Model S, Steve Jurvetson, a
Tesla board member, had a check at the ready in his wallet and slid it across the table to Musk after spying details on the Model S in
a packet of board meeting notes.
Othmer caught a Wired story about a planned second version of the Roadster and emailed Musk right away. “He said, ‘Okay, I
will sell it to you, but you have to pay two hundred thousand dollars right now.’” Othmer agreed, and Tesla had him come to the
company’s headquarters on a Sunday to sign some paperwork, acknowledging the price of the car and the fact that the company
didn’t quite know when it would arrive or what its specifications would be. “My guess is that it will be the fastest car on the road,”
Othmer said. “It’ll be four-wheel drive. It’s going to be insane. And I don’t really think that will be the real price. I just don’t think
Elon wanted me to buy it.”
18. Musk suspected Better Place came up with battery swapping as a plan after its CEO, Shai Agassi, heard about the technology
during a tour of the Tesla factory
19. Musk had made a number of art cars over the years at Burning Man, including an electric one shaped like a rocket. In 2011, he also
received a lot of grief from the Wall Street Journal for having a high-end camp. “Elon Musk, chief executive of electric-car maker
Tesla Motors and co-founder of eBay Inc.’s PayPal unit, is among those eschewing the tent life,” the paper wrote. “He is paying
for an elaborate compound consisting of eight recreational vehicles and trailers stocked with food, linens, groceries and other
essentials for himself and his friends and family, say employees of the outfitter, Classic Adventures RV. . . . Classic is one of the
festival’s few approved vendors. It charges $5,500 to $10,000 per RV for its Camp Classic Concierge packages like Mr. Musk’s. At
Mr. Musk’s RV enclave, the help empties septic tanks, brings water and makes sure the vehicles’ electricity, refrigeration, air
conditioning, televisions, DVD players and other systems are ship shape. The staff also stocked the campers with Diet Coke,
Gatorade and Cruzan rum.” Once the story hit, Musk’s group felt like Classic Adventures had leaked the information to drum up
business, and they tried to move to a new, undisclosed location.
20. http://www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf.
21. Tesla employees have been known to sneak across the street to the campus of the software maker SAP and to take advantage of
its sumptuous, subsidized cafes.
22. Shotwell talks about going to Mars as much as Musk and has dedicated her life to space exploration. Straubel has demonstrated the
same type of commitment with electric vehicles and can sound a lot like Musk at times. “We are not trying to corner the market on
EVs,” Straubel said. “There are 100 million cars built per year and 2 billion already out there. Even if we got to 5 or 10 percent of
the market, that does not solve the world’s problems. I am bullish we will keep up with demand and drive the whole industry
forward. Elon is committed to this.”
23. Page presented one of his far-out ideas to me as follows: “I was thinking it would be pretty cool to have a prize to fund a project
where someone would have to send something lightweight to the moon that could sort of replicate itself. I went over to the NASA
operation center here at AMES in Mountain View when they were doing a mission and literally flying a satellite into the south pole
of the moon. And they like hurled this thing into the moon at a high velocity and then it exploded and it sent matter out into space.
And then they looked at that with telescopes, and they discovered water on the south pole of the moon, which sounds really
exciting. I started thinking that if there’s a lot of water on the south pole of the moon, you can make rocket fuel from the hydrogen
and oxygen. The other cool thing about the south pole is like it almost always gets sun. There’s like places high up that get sun and
there’s places that are kind of in the craters that are very cold. So you have like a lot of energy then where you could run solar
cells. You could almost run like a steam turbine there. You have rocket fuel ingredients, and you have solar cells that can be
powered by sun, and you could probably run a power plant turbine. Power plant turbines aren’t that heavy. You could send that to
the moon. You have like a gigawatt of power on the moon and make a lot of rocket fuel. It would make a good prize project. You
send something to the moon that weights five pounds and have it make rocket fuel so that you could launch stuff off the moon or
have it make a copy of itself, so that you can make more of them.”ABOUT THE AUTHOR

www.harpercollins.com* Two years after the birth of his son, John Elon began to show signs of diabetes. The condition amounted to a death sentence at the
time and, despite being only thirty-two, John Elon learned that he would likely have six months or so to live. With a bit of nursing
experience behind her, Almeda took it upon herself to discover an elixir or treatment that would extend John Elon’s life. According to
family lore, she hit on chiropractic procedures as an effective remedy, and John Elon lived for five years following the original
diabetes diagnosis. The life-giving procedures established what would become an oddly rich chiropractic tradition in the Haldeman
family. Almeda studied at a chiropractic school in Minneapolis and earned her doctor of chiropractic, or, D.C., degree in 1905.
Musk’s great-grandmother went on to set up her own clinic and, as far as anyone can tell, became the first chiropractor to practice in
Canada.* Haldeman also entered politics, trying to start his own political party in Saskatchewan, publishing a newsletter, and espousing
conservative, antisocialist ideas. He would later make an unsuccessful run for Parliament and chair the Social Credit Party.* The journey took them up the African coast, across the Arabian Peninsula, all the way through Iran, India, and Malaysia and then
down the Timor Sea to Australia. It required one year of preparation just to secure all of the necessary visas and paperwork, and
they suffered from constant stomach bugs and an erratic schedule along the way. “Dad passed out crossing the Timor Sea, and mum
had to take over until they hit Australia. He woke up right before they landed,” said Scott Haldeman. “It was fatigue.”* Both Joshua and Wyn were accomplished marksmen and won national shooting competitions. In the mid-1950s, they also tied for first
place in the eight-thousand-mile Cape Town to Algiers Motor Rally, beating pros in their Ford station wagon.* Musk couldn’t remember this particular conversation. “I think they might be having creative recollection,” he said. “It’s possible. I
had lots of esoteric conversations the last couple years of high school, but I was more concerned about general technology than
banking.”* When Maye went to Canada to check out places to live, a fourteen-year-old Tosca seized the moment and put the family house in
South Africa up for sale. “She had sold my car as well and was in the midst of putting our furniture up for sale, too,” Maye said.
“When I got back, I asked her why. She said, ‘There is no need to delay. We are getting out of here.’”* The Musk brothers were not the most aggressive businessmen at this point. “I remember from their business plan that they were
originally asking for a ten-thousand-dollar investment for twenty-five percent of their company,” said Steve Jurvetson, the venture
capitalist. “That is a cheap deal! When I heard about the three-million-dollar investment, I wondered if Mohr Davidow had actually
read the business plan. Somehow, the brothers ended up raising a normal venture round.”* Musk also got to show off the new office to his mother, Maye, and Justine. Maye sometimes sat in on meetings and came up with the
idea of adding a “reverse directions” button on the Zip2 maps, which let people flip around their journeys and ended up becoming a
popular feature on all mapping services.* At one point, the founders thought the easiest way to solve their problems would just be to buy a bank and revamp it. While that
didn’t happen, they did snag a high-profile controller from Bank of America, who in turn explained, in painful detail, the complexities
of sourcing loans, transferring money, and protecting accounts.* Fricker disputed that he yearned to be CEO, saying instead that the other employees had encouraged him to take over because of
Musk’s struggles getting the business off the ground. Fricker and Musk, once close friends, remain unimpressed with each other.
“Elon has his own code of ethics and honor and plays the game extraordinarily hard,” Fricker said. “When it comes down to it, for
him, business is war.” According to Musk, “Harris is very smart, but I don’t think he has a good heart. He had a really intense desire
to be running the show, and he wanted to take the company in ridiculous directions.” Fricker went on to have a very successful
career as CEO of GMP Capital, a Canadian financial services company. Payne founded a private equity firm in Toronto.* Musk had been pushed out as CEO of X.com by the company’s investors, who wanted a more seasoned executive to lead the
company toward an IPO. In December 1999, X.com hired Bill Harris, the former CEO of the financial software maker Intuit, as its
new chief. After the merger, many in the company turned on Harris, he resigned, and Musk returned as the CEO.* After feeling ill for a few days, Musk went to Stanford Hospital and informed them that he’d been in a malaria zone, although the
doctors could not find the parasite during tests. The doctors performed a spinal tap and diagnosed him with viral meningitis. “I may
very well have also had that, and they treated me for it, and it did get better,” Musk said. The doctors discharged Musk from the
hospital and warned him that some symptoms would recur. “I started feeling bad a few days later, and it got progressively worse,”
Musk said. “Eventually, I couldn’t walk. It was like, ‘Okay, this is even worse than the first time.’” Justine took Musk to a general
practitioner in a cab, and he lay on the floor of the doctor’s office. “I was so dehydrated that she couldn’t take my vitals,” Musk said.
The doctor called an ambulance, which transported Musk to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City with IVs in both arms. Musk faced
another misdiagnosis—this time of the type of malaria. The doctors declined to give Musk a more aggressive treatment that came
with nasty side effects including heart palpitations and organ failure.* When Zubrin and some of the other Mars buffs heard of Musk’s plant project, they were upset. “It didn’t make any sense,” Zubrin
said. “It was a purely symbolic thing to do, and the second they opened that door, millions of microbes would escape and plague all of
NASA’s contamination protocols.”* Most of the stories written about Musk that touch on this period say he went to Moscow three times. According to Cantrell’s detailed
records, this is not the case. Musk met with the Russians twice in Moscow, and once in Pasadena, California. He also met with
Arianespace in Paris, and in London with Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd., which Musk considered buying.* Buzza knew Hollman’s work at Boeing and coaxed him to SpaceX about six months after the company started.* Including a 1,300-pound hunk of copper.* Before returning to El Segundo, Hollman used a drill press to remove the glasses’ safety shield. “I didn’t want to look like a nerd on
the flight home,” he said.* Hollman left the company after this incident in November 2007 and then returned for a spell to train new personnel. A number of
people I interviewed for the book said that Hollman was so key to SpaceX’s early days that they feared the company might flame out
without him.* In a press release announcing the funding round, Musk was not listed as a founder of the company. In the “About Tesla Motors”
section, the company stated, “Tesla Motors was founded in June 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to create efficient
electric cars for people who love to drive.” Musk and Eberhard would later spar over Musk’s founder status.* This was how the employee remembered the text. I did not see the actual e-mail. Musk later told the same employee, “I want you to
think ahead and think so hard every day that your head hurts. I want your head to hurt every night when you go to bed.”* Musk fought to set the record straight, as he saw it, on the Huffington Post and wrote a 1,500-word essay. Musk maintained that
two months of negotiations with independent parties had gone into the postnuptial agreement, which kept the couple’s assets separate
so that Musk could get the spoils from his companies and Justine could get the spoils from her books. “In mid 1999, Justine told me
that if I proposed to her, she would say yes,” Musk wrote. “Since this was not long after the sale of my first company, Zip2, to
Compaq, and the subsequent cofounding of PayPal, friends and family advised me to separate whether the marriage was for love or
money.” After the settlement, Musk asked Arianna Huffington to remove his essay about the divorce from her website. “I don’t
want to dwell on past negativity,” Musk said. “You can always find things on the Internet. So it’s not like it’s gone. It’s just not easily
found.”* The pair have continued to have their difficulties. For a long time, Musk ran all of the child-sharing scheduling through his assistant
Mary Beth Brown rather than dealing directly with Justine. “I was really pissed-off about that,” Justine said. And the time Justine
cried the most during our conversation came as she weighed the pros and cons of the children growing up on a grand stage where
they’re whisked away to the Super Bowl or Spain in a private jet on a moment’s notice or asked to play at the Tesla factory. “I know
the kids really look up to him,” she said. “He takes them everywhere and provides a lot of experiences for them. My role as the
mother is to create this reality where I provide a sense of normalcy. They are not growing up in a normal family with a normal dad.
Their life with me is a lot more low-key. We value different things. I am a lot more about empathy.”* Musk recalled their meeting as follows: “She did look great, but what was going through my mind was ‘Oh, I guess they are a couple
of models.’ You know, you can’t actually talk to most models. You just can’t have a conversation. But, you know, Talulah was really
int
erested in talking about rockets and electric cars. That was the interesting thing.”* He asked Riley to go with him, but she turned Musk down.* By this time, Musk had built up a reputation as the hardest-charging man in the space business. Before settling on the Falcon 9, Musk
planned to build something called the BFR, a.k.a. the Big Falcon Rocket or Big Fucking Rocket. Musk wanted it to have the biggest
rocket engine in history. Musk’s bigger, faster mentality amused, horrified and impressed some of the suppliers that SpaceX
occasionally turned to for help, like Barber-Nichols Inc., a Colorado-based maker of rocket engine turbo pumps and other aerospace
machinery. A few executives at Barber-Nichols—Robert Linden, Gary Frey, and Mike Forsha—were kind enough to recount their
first meeting with Musk in the middle of 2002 and their subsequent dealings with him. Here’s a snippet:
“Elon showed up with Tom Mueller and started telling us it was his destiny to launch things into space at lower costs and to help
us become space faring people. We thought the world of Tom but weren’t quite sure whether to take Elon too seriously. They began
asking us for the impossible. They wanted a turbo pump to be built in less than a year for under one million dollars. Boeing might do a
project like that over five years for one hundred million. Tom told us to give it our best shot, and we built it in thirteen months. Build
quick and learn quickly was Elon’s philosophy. He was relentless in wanting the costs to come down. Regardless of what we showed
him on paper with regard to the cost of materials, he wanted the cost lower because that was part of his business model. It could be
very frustrating to work with Elon. He has a singular view and doesn’t deviate from that. We don’t know too many people that have
worked for him that are happy. That said, he has driven the cost of space down and been true to his original business plan. Boeing,
Lockheed, and the rest of them have become overly cautious and spend a lot of money. SpaceX has balls.”* To provide a glimpse of how well Musk knows the rockets, here he is explaining what happened from memory six years after the
fact: “It was because we had upgraded the Merlin engine to a regeneratively cooled engine and the thrust transient of that engine
was a few seconds longer. It was only like one percent thrust for about another 1.5 seconds. And the chamber pressure was only ten
PSI, which is one percent of the total. But that’s below sea level pressure. On the test stand, we didn’t notice anything. We thought it
was fine. We thought it was just the same as before, but actually it just had this slight difference. The ambient sea level pressure was
higher at roughly fifteen PSI, which disguised some effects during the test. The extra thrust caused the first stage to continue moving
after stage separation and recontact the other stage. And the upper stage then started the engine inside the interstage, which caused
the plasma blowback which destroyed that upper stage.”* Musk would later discover the identity of this employee in an ingenious way. He copied the text of the letter into a Word document,
checked the size of the file, sent it to a printer, and looked over the logs of printer activity to find one of the same size. He could then
trace that back to the person who had printed the original file. The employee wrote a letter of apology and resigned.* Griffin had pined to build a massive new spacecraft that would solidify his mark on the industry. But, with the election of Barack
Obama in 2008, the Bush appointee knew that his time as NASA chief was coming to an end and that SpaceX appeared poised to
build the most interesting machines moving forward.* It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt reusable rockets will work, in large part because of the
stress the machines and metal go through during launch. It’s not clear that the most prized customers will even consider the reused
spacecraft for launches due to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and companies have not pursued the
technology. There’s a camp of space experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his time, and that engineering calculations already
prove the reusable rockets to be a fool’s errand.* Blue Origin also hired away a large chunk of SpaceX’s propulsion team.* Musk has taken exception to Blue Origin and Bezos filing for patents around reusable rocket technology as well. “His patent is
completely ridiculous,” Musk said. “People have proposed landing on a floating platform in the ocean for a half century. There’s no
chance whatsoever of the patent being upheld because there’s five decades of prior art of people who proposed that six ways to
Sunday in fiction and nonfiction. It’s like Dr. Seuss, green eggs and fucking ham. That’s how many ways it’s been proposed. The
is
sue is doing it and like actually creating a rocket that can make that happen.”* Michael Colonno.* According to Musk, “The early Dragon Version 1 work was just me and maybe three or four engineers, as we were living hand to
mouth and had no idea if NASA would award us a contract. Technically, there was Magic Dragon before that, which was much
simpler, as it had no NASA requirements. Magic Dragon was just me and some high altitude balloon guys in the U.K.”* NASA researchers studying the Dragon design have noticed several features of the capsule that appear to have been purpose built
from the get-go to accommodate a landing on Mars. They’ve published a couple of papers explaining how it could be feasible for
NASA to fund a mission to Mars in which a Dragon capsule picks up samples and returns them to Earth.* The politicking in the space business can get quite nasty. Lori Garver, the former deputy administrator of NASA, spent years fighting
to open up NASA contracts so that private companies could bid on things like resupplying the ISS. Her position of fostering a strong
relationship between NASA and the private sector won out in the end but at a cost. “I had death threats and fake anthrax sent to
me,” she said. Garver also ran across SpaceX competitors that tried to spread unfounded gossip about the company and Musk.
“They claimed he was in violation of tax laws in South Africa and had another, secret family there. I said, ‘You’re making this stuff
up.’ We’re lucky that people with such long-term visions as Elon, Jeff Bezos, and Robert Bigelow [founder of the aerospace
company that bears his name] got rich. It’s nuts that people would want to vilify Elon. He might say some things that rub people the
wrong way, but, at some point, the being nice to everyone thing doesn’t work.”* On this flight, SpaceX secretly placed a wheel of cheese inside the Dragon capsule. It was the same one Jeff Skoll had given Musk
back in the mice-to-Mars days.* Musk explained the look to me in a way that only he can. “I went for a similar style to the Model S (it uses the same screens as
Model S upgraded for space ops), but kept the aluminum isogrid uncovered for a more exotic feel.”* Rather insanely, NASA is building a next-generation, giant spaceship that could one day get to Mars even though SpaceX is building
the same type of craft—the Falcon Heavy—on its own. NASA’s program is budgeted to cost $18 billion, although government
studies say that figure is very conservative. “NASA has no fucking business doing this,” said Andrew Beal, the billionaire investor
and onetime commercial space entrepreneur. “The whole space shuttle system was a disaster. They’re fucking clueless. Who in their
right mind would use huge solid boosters, especially ones built in segments requiring dynamic seals? They are so lucky they only had
one disastrous failure of the boosters.” Beal’s firm criticisms come from years of watching the government compete against private
space companies by subsidizing the construction of spacecraft and launches. His company Beal Aerospace quit the business because
the government kept funding competing rockets. “Governments around the world have spent billions trying to do what Elon is doing,
and they have failed,” he said. “We have to have governments, but the idea that the government goes out and competes with
companies is fucking nuts.”* The volume level on the sound system naturally goes to 11—an homage to This Is Spinal Tap and a reflection of Musk’s sense of
humor.* And it’s not just that the Model S and other electric cars are three to four times more efficient than internal combustion vehicles.
They can also tap into power that is produced in centralized, efficient ways by power plants and solar arrays.* When the very first Roadster arrived, it came in a large plywood crate. Tesla’s engineers unpacked it furiously, installed the battery
pack, and then let Musk take it for a spin. About twenty Tesla engineers jumped in prototype vehicles and formed a convoy that
followed Musk around Palo Alto and Stanford.* At some point from late 2007 to 2008, Musk also tried to hire Tony Fadell, an executive at Apple who is credited with bringing the
iPod and iPhone to life. Fadell remembered being recruited for the CEO job at Tesla, while Musk remembered it more as a chief
operating officer type of position. “Elon and I had multiple discussions about me joining as Tesla’s CEO, and he even went to the
le
ngths of staging a surprise party for me when I was going to visit their offices,” Fadell said. Steve Jobs caught wind of these
meetings and turned on the charm to keep Fadell. “He was sure nice to me for a while,” Fadell said. A couple of years later, Fadell
le
ft Apple to found Nest, a maker of smart-home devices, which Google then acquired in 2014.* It took a couple of years, from about 2007 to 2009, for the Energy Department application to morph into the actual possibility of a
lo
an from the government.* The deal had two parts. Tesla would keep making battery packs and associated technology that other companies might use, and it
would produce its own electric vehicles at a manufacturing facility in the United States.* Musk had received a lot of pushback internally for trying to locate a car factory in or near California. “All the guys in Detroit said it
needs to be in a place where the labor can afford to live and be happy,” Lloyd said. “There’s a lot of learned skill on an assembly line,
and you can’t afford turnover.” Musk responded that SpaceX had found a way to build rockets in Los Angeles, and that Tesla would
find a way to build cars in Northern California. His stubbornness ended up being fortuitous for the company. “If it hadn’t been for
that DOE loan, and the NUMMI plant, there’s no way Tesla would have ended up being so successful, so fast,” Lloyd said.* Boeing used to make fuselages for the 747 in the SpaceX building and painted them in what became the Tesla design studio.* “He picks the most visible place on purpose,” said the investor and Tesla board member Steve Jurvetson. “He’s at Tesla just about
every Saturday and Sunday and wants people to see him and know they can find him. Then, he can also call suppliers on the
weekend, and let them know that he’s personally putting in the hours on the factory floor and expects the same from them.”* Tesla got its start using the same lithium ion batteries that go into consumer electronics like laptops. During the early days of the
Roadster, this proved a risky but calculated choice. Tesla wanted to tap into Asia’s mature battery suppliers and get access to cheap
products that would keep improving over time. The press played up Tesla’s use of these types of batteries, and consumers were
fascinated by the idea that a car could be powered by the same energy source sitting inside of their gizmos.
There’s a major misconception that Tesla still depends on these types of batteries. Yes, the batteries inside the Model S look like
those found in a laptop. Tesla, however, started developing its own battery chemistry in conjunction with partners like Panasonic
dating back to late models of the Roadster. Tesla can still use the same manufacturing equipment as consumer electronics companies
while ending up with a battery that’s safer and better tuned to the intense charging demands of its cars. Along with the secret
formula for the battery cells themselves, Tesla has improved the performance of its batteries by developing its own techniques for
linking the cells together and cooling them. The battery cells have been designed to vent heat in a very particular way, and there’s
coolant running throughout the entire battery pack. The battery packs are assembled at the Tesla factory in an area hidden from
visitors.
The chemistry, the batteries, the battery pack design—these are all elements of a large, continuous system that Tesla has built
from the ground up to allow its cars to charge at record speed. To control the heat produced during the charging process, Tesla has
designed an interlinked system of radiators and chillers to cool both the batteries and the chargers. “You’ve got all that hardware plus
the software management system and other controllers,” said J. B. Straubel. “All of these things are running at maximum rate.” A
Model S can recharge 150 miles of range in 20 minutes at one of Tesla’s charging stations with DC power pumping straight into the
batteries. By comparison, a Nissan Leaf that maxes out at 80 miles of range can take 8 hours to recharge.* Google’s attorneys had asked to make a presentation to Tesla’s board. Before he would permit this, Musk asked for the right to call
on Google for a loan in case Tesla encountered cash flow issues after acquisition talks became public, as there would otherwise be
no way for Tesla to raise money. Google hesitated on this for a few weeks, by which time Tesla ended up in the clear.* Following the demonstration, Tesla struggled to deliver on the battery swap technology. Musk had promised that the first few stations
would arrive in late 2013. A year after the event, though, Tesla had yet to open a single station. According to Musk, the company
ended up needing to deal with more pressing issues. “We’re going to do it because we said we’d do it,” Musk said. “It may not be on
the schedule that we’d like but we always come through in the end.

In the next video, I introduce Flask & Socket.io to establish bi-directional client-server communication. Ultimately, this will be done to connect our model to the simulation.

That being said, the content in the next two videos is very technical, and not very relevant to deep learning. I would still highly recommend following along the two videos so that you don't get lost.

Otherwise, if you choose to skip the two videos, then that's fine. You'll have to simply copy the code below into an atom project, drag your model into the same project, make the appropriate installations and run the code to establish the connection. Then run your simulation.
